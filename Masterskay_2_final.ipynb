see him sitting out in the hall right now &amp;#39;cause i&amp;#39;m telling you i&amp;#39;ve never seen anything like him that&amp;#39;s exactly what i mean because of the way he&amp;#39;s lived uh he doesn&amp;#39;t seem to know what things are i mean things you and i take for granted common everyday objects simple ideas i just don&amp;#39;t think he&amp;#39;s ever been exposed to them i mean he&amp;#39;s about the most well read teenage kid you could ever meet but in other ways i think he&amp;#39;s a lot like a little child why you look like that you look like some kind of vampire from outer space or something they kick you out of cancer camp you got some kind of disease don&amp;#39;t look at me man did you hear what i said i don&amp;#39;t like your eyes what&amp;#39;s a new guy

fine shape and the optometrist said his contact lenses will be here the end of the week they&amp;#39;ll be callin&amp;#39; him ol&amp;#39; blue eyes in time for the county fair you guys are

like to attend school one day next week i can arrange it will my contacts be ready by monday hey hey guys molecules when we speed up the course of molecules we get energy and um since we are all basically just a mass of molecules what does our brain send out to all the other parts of the body lindsey um impulses yeah electric impulses jeremy turn your head and look at lindsey yes that&amp;#39;s lovely that&amp;#39;s very good you&amp;#39;ve just relayed electricity your brain sent out an electric impulse down to your neck muscles and uh what what turned your head besides the obvious what your what your muscles used to turn your head it&amp;#39;s energy energy always relaying always transforming and never ending now looky here this is a uh a jacob&amp;#39;s ladder it&amp;#39;s a science fair toy and it&amp;#39;s uh built to show us how electricity travels okay can we get the uh shutters watch this ooh hey cut it out cut it out ooh look at this blinding isn&amp;#39;t it now who can tell me why electricity travels uh boredom huh he tickles me no no potential potential one side of this thing is positive while the other side has a strong negative pull and uh that&amp;#39;s all the potential that electricity needs to travel that&amp;#39;s right that&amp;#39;s pretty good don&amp;#39;t i bring you good entertaining things but you get the idea that it does you know it travels and just keeps going did you ever what&amp;#39;s your experience with electricity did you ever you know run your feet over a carpet like that and touch somebody what happens static electricity that&amp;#39;s right that&amp;#39;s right now where does it go when you touch somebody it just goes out so so so electricity like energy uh just um uh recycles it flows in a cycle that doesn&amp;#39;t end it uh are you all right mr ripley are you okay the local news and those channel people are outside so is jimmy hobbs from the newspaper tell them to go home oh come on doug they ain&amp;#39;t goin&amp;#39; anywhere till somebody goes out there and talks to &amp;#39;em tell them there&amp;#39;s no fatalities no sex scandal that will get rid of them fast god damn it doug i

doug the kid doesn&amp;#39;t have a scratch on him heart rate&amp;#39;s a little irregular but nothing to indicate the kind of electrical shock you&amp;#39;re talking about right right and he&amp;#39;s got a hole uh burned in his shirt the size of a bowling ball something&amp;#39;s happened here something&amp;#39;s happened here i&amp;#39;m telling you with everything we know about science about the makeup of the human body what happened in that classroom is impossible that kid attracted an arc of electricity from feet away and not just from the jacob&amp;#39;s ladder i mean after a second it was like it was comin&amp;#39; at him out of the whole building you want to know why there isn&amp;#39;t a hair on him why because he is electrolysis it can&amp;#39;t grow on him doc

silence before a football play begins players are in position linemen are frozen and anything is possible almost indian summer weather here in mid november then like a traffic accident stuff begins to randomly collide from the snap of the ball to the snap of the first bone is closer to four seconds than five first and riggins flea flicker back to theismann theismann&amp;#39;s in a lot of trouble one mississippi joe theismann the redskins&amp;#39; quarterback takes the snap and hands off to his running back first and riggins two mississippi it&amp;#39;s a trick play a flea flicker and the running back tosses the ball back to the quarterback flea flicker back to theismann three mississippi up to now the play&amp;#39;s been defined by what the quarterback sees lt&amp;#39;s about to be defined by what he doesn&amp;#39;t four mississippi lawrence taylor is the best defensive player in the nfl and has been from the time he stepped onto the field as a rookie theismann&amp;#39;s in a lot of trouble and it was lawrence taylor who slammed theismann to the ground at the yard line the blitz was on he will also change the game of football as we know it we&amp;#39;ll look at it with the reverse angle one more time and l suggest if your stomach is weak you just don&amp;#39;t watch legendary quarterback joe theismann never played another down of football now y&amp;#39;all would guess that more often than not the highest paid player on an nfl team is a quarterback and you&amp;#39;d be right but what you probably don&amp;#39;t know is more often than not the second highest paid player is thanks to lawrence taylor a left tackle because as every housewife knows the first check you write is for the mortgage but the second is for the insurance and the left tackle&amp;#39;s job is to protect the quarterback from what he can&amp;#39;t see coming to protect his blind side the ideal left tackle is big but a lot of people are big he&amp;#39;s wide in the butt and massive in the thighs he has long arms giant hands and feet as quick as a hiccup this is a rare and expensive combination the need for which can be traced to that monday night game and lawrence taylor for on that day he not only altered joe theismann&amp;#39;s life but mine as well mr oher mr oher do you understand do you know why l&amp;#39;m here to investigate yes to investigate i&amp;#39;m here to investigate your odd predicament do you find it odd your predicament michael i don&amp;#39;t know can l can l leave now no you can&amp;#39;t where&amp;#39;s coach cotton&amp;#39;s office thanks man

though you might need some players what kind of sport does he play anything with a ball the boy&amp;#39;s good too classes start in a week it&amp;#39;d have to be for next semester i know what you&amp;#39;re thinking coach but look here l got money all right see l&amp;#39;m a mechanic at wilson&amp;#39;s auto the other side of town well look what if somebody drops out or moves could they

which is sixth percentile his grade point average begins with zero everyone passed him along they gave him d&amp;#39;s so they could hand their problem off to the next school he&amp;#39;s a brave kid for wanting to come here for wanting a quality education an education denied him by the poor quality of schools he&amp;#39;s attended most kids with his background wouldn&amp;#39;t come within miles of this place coach cotton we understand your interest in this young man&amp;#39;s athletic abilities he wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to play sports until he got his grades up forget sports look at the wall christian we either take that seriously or we paint over it you don&amp;#39;t admit michael oher because of sports you admit him because it&amp;#39;s the right thing to do class this is mike oher

i&amp;#39;m going behind your back i know you put us down as michael&amp;#39;s medical contact at school there is a huge difference between paying for a broken arm and being legally responsible for someone l mean a kid we barely know that&amp;#39;s another thing we need to find out more about his past he won&amp;#39;t talk about it he&amp;#39;s like an onion you have to peel him back a layer at a time not if you use a knife what if we took him to a child psychologist or something do you really expect big mike to michael do you expect michael to lie on a couch and talk about his childhood like he&amp;#39;s woody allen i mean michael&amp;#39;s gift is his ability to forget he&amp;#39;s mad at no one and he really doesn&amp;#39;t care what happened in the past you&amp;#39;re right excuse me you&amp;#39;re right how&amp;#39;d those words taste coming out of your mouth like vinegar well at least promise me you&amp;#39;ll think about it all right all right you&amp;#39;ll think about it

very little on michael most of his files have been lost well what is in there a few case notes this one describes an incident where officers forcibly removed michael from denise oher&amp;#39;s care when michael was quite a scene evidently they had to split up the kids and it&amp;#39;s far from the worst where is she his mother i don&amp;#39;t know lf you find her we got a heap more files we could add to well how many kids does she have least a dozen probably lf not more with her drug arrest record my guess would be she can&amp;#39;t even remember can l see that so we would need her permission right no michael is a ward of the state just apply and get a judge to sign off on it so you would just give him away without even telling his mother man check out this piece right here man

l&amp;#39;m in front seen it a thousand times ever seen it from the front of the line next year you and me leading the team tennessee offered to let me run on the field and flip the coin i&amp;#39;ll throw in a sideline pass have you decided yet michael no miss sue but you like tennessee yeah that&amp;#39;s a good school not at the academic level of ole miss but they have a outstanding science department you know what they&amp;#39;re famous for they work with the fbi to study the effects of soil on decomposing body parts what&amp;#39;s that mean well when they find a body the police wanna know how long it&amp;#39;s been dead so the fine folks at tennessee help them out oh they have lots of body parts arms and legs and hands from hospitals and medical schools and do you know where they store them right underneath the football field so while it&amp;#39;s fine and dandy to have fans cheering for you the bodies you should be worried about are the ones right under the turf set to poke up through the ground and grab you well it&amp;#39;s your decision where you wanna play ball don&amp;#39;t let me influence you all the other teachers are on board i don&amp;#39;t know what your problem is i&amp;#39;m sorry i will not give a student a grade he or she doesn&amp;#39;t deserve well michael needs a b what does he have to do to deserve that right now michael&amp;#39;s doing c minus d plus work his best chance at improvement is the written essay at the end of the year it counts for a third of the grade well that&amp;#39;s it we&amp;#39;re sunk why don&amp;#39;t you write about great expectations you&amp;#39;re a lot like pip i mean he was poor he was an orphan and someone kind of found him you should be able to relate to that fine we&amp;#39;ll go through the reading list but you&amp;#39;re gonna have to pick one michael pygmalion a tale of two cities the charge of the light brigade half a league half a league half a league onward i love that one he loves it why don&amp;#39;t you do this and l&amp;#39;ll watch basketball okay all in the valley of death rode the six hundred they named lsu&amp;#39;s stadium death valley because of this story alfred lord tennyson was writing about lsu ole miss you&amp;#39;re kidding no lt&amp;#39;s a great story lt&amp;#39;s a poem forward the light brigade that&amp;#39;s like the offense charge for the guns it&amp;#39;s the end zone into the valley of death rode the six hundred forward the light brigade was there a man dismay&amp;#39;d not tho&amp;#39; the soldier knew someone had blunder&amp;#39; someone made a mistake yeah their leader their coach but why would they go ahead if they knew he messed up theirs not to make reply theirs not to reason why into the valley of death rode the six hundred they&amp;#39;re all gonna die aren&amp;#39;t they yeah that&amp;#39;s really really sad i think you just found something to write about michael courage is a hard thing to figure you can have courage based on a dumb idea or a mistake but you&amp;#39;re not supposed to question adults or your coach or your teacher because they make the rules maybe they know best but maybe they don&amp;#39;t it all depends on who you are where you come from didn&amp;#39;t at least one of the guys think about giving up and joining with the other side i mean valley of death that&amp;#39;s pretty salty stuff that&amp;#39;s why courage is tricky should you always do what others tell you to do sometimes you might not even know why you&amp;#39;re doing something i mean any fool can have courage but honor that&amp;#39;s the real reason you either do something or you don&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s who you are and maybe who you want to be if you die trying for something important then you have both honor and courage and that&amp;#39;s pretty good i think that&amp;#39;s what the writer was saying that you should hope for courage and try for honor and maybe even pray that the people telling you what to do have some too kevin lin good job excuse me excuse me excuse me matthew nichols hmm michael&amp;#39;s final gpa got it off of paul&amp;#39;s computer he did it sean he did it wait a minute you broke into the principal&amp;#39;s computer hmm michael oher michael where in the world did you find a baby picture of michael scanned it off an internet ad for a toddler boutique congratulations michael

assistant director of enforcement for the ncaa please call me leigh anne so let&amp;#39;s do this shall we if you wouldn&amp;#39;t mind i&amp;#39;d prefer to speak with michael alone and how long is

this one this woman is tough tough tough tough tough hold on hey the client wants what were you aware that coach cotton was accepting a job at ole miss no and that this job offer came after you signed with them sean tuohy your legal guardian went to ole miss he played basketball and mrs tuohy went to ole miss as well she was a cheerleader is it safe to say that ole miss is their favorite school do they like any other universities what about say tennessee no they can&amp;#39;t stand tennessee and your tutor miss sue miss sue miss sue is an ole miss grad too miss sue ever try to persuade you to attend ole miss did you know that the tuohys make generous donations to ole miss that even miss sue makes donations that the tuohys they have a condo in oxford so they can attend as many athletic events as possible that in fact both sean and leigh anne tuohy are by our definition boosters mr oher do you understand do you know why l&amp;#39;m here to investigate yes to investigate i&amp;#39;m

will become legal guardians of young athletes without means and funnel them to their alma maters i&amp;#39;m not saying l believe it i&amp;#39;m not saying l don&amp;#39;t but there are many people involved in this case who would argue that the tuohys they took you in they clothed you no they fed you they paid for your private education they bought you a car paid for a tutor no no all as part of a plan to ensure that you play football for the university of mississippi michael we&amp;#39;re not finished the toile&amp;#39;s not available like l told you months ago so why don&amp;#39;t we go

saint helena no one knows exactly what happens next but the version i like goes like this he&amp;#39;s very depressed and decides to take his own life but napoleon believes himself to be of such superhuman strength that he takes six times the amount of poison needed to do the job his stomach is so full up with poison that his body rejects it and he doesn&amp;#39;t die see ego saved his life maybe he need glasses glasses yes to read words on bottle poison it&amp;#39;s funny you should say that rumor has it that napoleon was farsighted there you go there you go there you go and there you

lucky to be here at all what do you mean i found you and i saved your life by bringing you here i don&amp;#39;t understand i there&amp;#39;s been an attack what an attack a big one i&amp;#39;m not sure yet if it&amp;#39;s chemical or nuclear but down here we&amp;#39;re safe and where are we exactly underneath my farmhouse forty miles outside of lake charles i was driving north of here you were in an accident you were turned over on the side of the road i was driving by and i saw i saved your life michelle i couldn&amp;#39;t just leave you there okay well thank you so much for saving my life i guess i should go to a hospital now you can&amp;#39;t leave an attack means fallout which contaminates the air above ground that&amp;#39;s how it works how long do we have to wait until it&amp;#39;s safe depends on the proximity of the closest blast one year maybe two and that&amp;#39;s if we&amp;#39;re talking about weapons that we know of russians are developing some nasty stuff and if the martians finally figured out a way to get here their weapons will make the russkies&amp;#39; look like sticks and stones luckily i&amp;#39;ve prepared for this right well i&amp;#39;ll need to use your phone then to call my family and tell them that i&amp;#39;m safe here and make sure they&amp;#39;re okay michelle they&amp;#39;re not okay how do you know that everyone outside of here is dead but what about you don&amp;#39;t you have a family who&amp;#39;s that excuse me what did you do you know what michelle i&amp;#39;m gonna tell you what i told him you need to eat you need to sleep and you need to start showing me a little bit of appreciation my name is howard by the way oh god oh shit i&amp;#39;m sorry i&amp;#39;m sorry about that uh i didn&amp;#39;t mean to scare you are you um here you hungry so how are you doing you okay what is this it&amp;#39;s a bunker your room&amp;#39;s a little bit of a fixer upper but at least you got a door a scary door but you still got a door how long have you been down here couple of days i think you know it&amp;#39;s actually kind of hard to tell with no windows or sunlight or anything i mean how do we get out of here oh he didn&amp;#39;t tell you about getting out of here is the last thing you want to do because the air up there it&amp;#39;s contaminated i see you&amp;#39;ve met emmett what happened to him he did that to himself and his stumbling around isn&amp;#39;t helping anything what you heard earlier was him knocking over a shelf with a whole week&amp;#39;s worth of food which he&amp;#39;s sorry for correct totally let&amp;#39;s go bathroom time this is the common area good for r r as you can see i&amp;#39;ve planned for a long stay the aquaponics system cleans the air and keeps it fresh this is the living room help yourself to any reading if you like to watch films i have some on dvd and vhs cassette just make sure you put them back in their sleeve when they&amp;#39;re done the kitchen&amp;#39;s fully functional has an electric stove refrigerator freezer silverware and that table&amp;#39;s a family heirloom which means watch your glasses always use coasters and placemats keep your hands to yourself understand no touching take a seat this way this is my private space off limits unless i give express permission go ahead i don&amp;#39;t need to you will though and i&amp;#39;ve got to pace these things out so please i need privacy you&amp;#39;re welcome to close the curtain i can&amp;#39;t with you standing there and i can&amp;#39;t trust you not to burn this place down this is for my own safety i&amp;#39;m not some pervert just go don&amp;#39;t flush unless you&amp;#39;ve gone we can&amp;#39;t afford wasted flushes take a seat are you hungry those are megan&amp;#39;s she never went anywhere without two or three of those things who&amp;#39;s megan megan&amp;#39;s not with us anymore don&amp;#39;t worry just the generator maybe it&amp;#39;s a car outside that&amp;#39;s not possible i heard one earlier above my room if you had heard a car the driver would be long dead by now well shouldn&amp;#39;t we at least try to call the police or someone to find out what actually happened there&amp;#39;s no one left to call see that nothing&amp;#39;s coming through you think i sound crazy i mean it&amp;#39;s amazing you people you wear helmets when you ride your bikes you have seat belts in your cars you have alarm systems to protect your homes but what do you do when those alarms go off crazy is building your ark after the flood has already come i think maybe it&amp;#39;s time you met frank and mildred closest i could get to an airlock see what happened to them they weren&amp;#39;t as lucky as you it&amp;#39;s the air michelle that&amp;#39;s what happens when you get exposed i keep this door sealed at all times no one comes in or out met frank and mildred huh it&amp;#39;s funny right the whole world ends and the thing he&amp;#39;s most upset about is a pair of dead pigs you in need of some reading material i took all the quizzes sorry but i did learn how to do a french braid so you know if you want me to do that for you just let me know what do you know about him he was in the navy i know that i guess he did uh some stuff with satellites what kind of stuff satellite stuff well what brought him out here i&amp;#39;m not sure he bought this property a while back but i never paid much attention till he hired me to help him get this place set up the work was entertaining though that&amp;#39;s for sure you know howard&amp;#39;s like a black belt in conspiracy theory plus you know how often do you get hired to help build a doomsday bunker so he didn&amp;#39;t kidnap you no what about your arm weren&amp;#39;t you trying to escape i was trying to get in i watched howard build this place piece by piece for years he was always talking about you know possible attacks from al qaeda russia south korea you mean north korea is that the crazy one so yeah that one and uh you know poured all his money into this place took to it like his life depended on it which you know that stays with you so he told you all this while you&amp;#39;re building his bomb shelter and now he says that the air is contaminated and everybody&amp;#39;s dead yeah i know what you&amp;#39;re getting at but there&amp;#39;s more to it howard abducted me he drove me off the road and he dragged me here so whatever he&amp;#39;s telling you about the air some big attack the purpose of this shelter is a lie no no way the attack i saw it myself what do you mean i was on my way home from work and it looked like a flash bright red like an explosion from way far off it wasn&amp;#39;t like fireworks naw this was more like something you&amp;#39;d read about in the bible so what you saw what a flash of light lightning a fire that flared up i&amp;#39;m not explaining it right this wasn&amp;#39;t like anything i&amp;#39;d ever seen and so my first thought was to come here and when i got here howard was closing the door and i could see it right there on his face he knew something was happening something bad and so i fought my way in i heard a car right here above us you heard someone right above us that isn&amp;#39;t possible the air is what contaminated how do you know that because i told him dinner&amp;#39;s ready i see you two are getting along hmm how&amp;#39;s that sauce it&amp;#39;s fine as cooks go i&amp;#39;m okay not great but okay megan was a good cook you&amp;#39;ll learn to love cooking mmm mmm it&amp;#39;s delicious that&amp;#39;s the best sauce i&amp;#39;ve ever tasted are you being funny no i mean considering the alternative which is you know getting burnt up in a chemical attack or nuclear i&amp;#39;d say being alive and down here would make a fried turd taste pretty good so best damn sauce i ever had that&amp;#39;s not a bad point and please watch your language at table right you know what i haven&amp;#39;t been able to get out of my head for some reason ever since i got down here tattoos always wanted one but i never got any &amp;#39;cause everybody always said no no emmett you&amp;#39;ll never get a decent job if you do that whatever like that matters now right t ell you what if i had known this was coming i would&amp;#39;ve gotten like of them i swear man i would look like a circus freak or something i&amp;#39;d just be covered head to toe tattoos all over my you know everywhere face sure right there across my forehead just my name emmett or you know thug life yolo i don&amp;#39;t even know what that means but you know i hear people saying it all the time so it must be cool hey what about you howard anything you wish you&amp;#39;d done in all honesty no no no crazy nights in vegas maybe uh take a pilgrimage to waco everything i wanted to do i did i focused on being prepared and i was and here we are oh my goodness is that monopoly there we go yeah that&amp;#39;s how we kill the time what would you say howard we&amp;#39;re gonna be down here what like a year two maybe i bet you if we started a game right now we might even get halfway finished by the time stop talking you don&amp;#39;t need to make jokes about how long we&amp;#39;re going to be down here when nobody knows how long that&amp;#39;s going to be your humor is not funny i don&amp;#39;t appreciate it while i&amp;#39;m trying to eat and neither does michelle now please shut up and let us eat in peace hmm emmett would you pass me a napkin thank you i know what you&amp;#39;re saying i never could finish monopoly that game really does

i mean good lord it was pretty scary could you hand me the salt please ah shoot i&amp;#39;m sorry i&amp;#39;m gonna need the pepper also what exactly do you think you&amp;#39;re doing i&amp;#39;m asking for pepper like hell you were what was that i don&amp;#39;t know what you&amp;#39;re talking about howard are you trying to insult me here in the shelter that i built that&amp;#39;s keeping you

car your accident was my fault when i found out about the incoming attack i got frantic i knew i needed to get back here as soon as possible so i was driving like a maniac i tried to pass you and i&amp;#39;m the reason you went off the road i mean i know i seem like a sensible guy but at the time i wasn&amp;#39;t myself it was an accident but it was my fault i was afraid to tell you and i&amp;#39;m sorry um you should shower even the smallest amount of air that came through the hinges could be toxic these were megan&amp;#39;s if you want i recognized that woman&amp;#39;s car her name was leslie i think you knew her she was a neighbor emmett wasn&amp;#39;t the only one who knew about this place if any others somehow survived they could be coming here too as of friday kindness and generosity are antiquated customs i&amp;#39;m going to need some stitches what you want me to this is your doing isn&amp;#39;t it i mean i don&amp;#39;t think i&amp;#39;m really qualified i&amp;#39;ll walk you through it here have a drink what is it technically it&amp;#39;s vodka ah it&amp;#39;s safe i distilled it myself i just said i distilled it i didn&amp;#39;t say anything about it actually tasting good yeah that&amp;#39;s awful you want it on the rocks little trick i taught myself as a young man stationed on a ship with way too much free time every now and again if the co was working us too hard we&amp;#39;d freeze and snap the knob off the bathroom door while he was still inside it usually took him an hour or two to get out i&amp;#39;m good suit yourself cheers ah this is clean all you need to do is stitch you&amp;#39;re doing fine some stuff i grabbed from your car i didn&amp;#39;t have time to bring in the booze sadly what is all that i wanted to design clothes no wonder you were so good with the stitches megan wanted to be an artist she was your daughter yes she was smart loved to read the magazines were just for fun she inhaled books anything with paris she liked their movies their culture you know we used to have this little joke every once in a while i&amp;#39;d ask her what do you want to be when you grow up you know what she&amp;#39;d say french anyway her mother turned her against me took her off to chicago people are strange creatures you can&amp;#39;t always convince them that safety is in their own best interest you don&amp;#39;t know they&amp;#39;re gone anyway at least i tried to help them hey there was nothing you could&amp;#39;ve done for that woman even if you let her in she still would&amp;#39;ve died you asked earlier about regrets yeah i&amp;#39;ve got some of those welcome to the club i mean i lived my life in a mile radius and that was by design i made sure that happened i was so fast in high school i even managed to outrun my bad grades i was all state track three years in a row caught a full ride to louisiana tech up there in ruston i remember i spent the last two weeks of that summer showing off the bus ticket they sent me to anybody who&amp;#39;d take a look at it and then came the night before i was supposed to leave and i just got so worried about how bad i was gonna do up there with all those smart kids so i went out of my way to get just piss wasted so bad that i knew there was no chance i was waking up in the morning so i missed the bus and i didn&amp;#39;t buy a ticket for the next one or the one after that well if you&amp;#39;d gone you might be dead now yeah lucky me right lucky us a few years ago i was at a hardware store and there was this little girl with her dad and he was in a hurry and she wasn&amp;#39;t keeping up so he kept yanking on her arm but really hard you know too hard i know that feeling when my dad got that way my brother colin was always there to take the worst of it for me and i thought seeing this little girl i thought maybe i could do that for her but i just kept watching and they&amp;#39;re about to leave and i&amp;#39;ve done nothing and she slips and it throws him off balance and he hits her and i wanted so badly to do something to help her but i did what i always do when things get hard i just panicked and ran look we&amp;#39;re here we&amp;#39;re alive and that means something it&amp;#39;s gotta you&amp;#39;ve got to be kidding me what we&amp;#39;re missing pieces here look at this poor cat he&amp;#39;s been deformed he&amp;#39;s got one eye he&amp;#39;s about to go snorkeling and everything too what are you doing ooh cornering the market on post apocalyptic fashion huh mmm hmm you need more axes and chain saws for what she has a shotgun yeah but what if up there it&amp;#39;s like what lumberjacks zombies though even howard doesn&amp;#39;t think that one&amp;#39;s plausible but you should hear his theory about mutant space worms what is that howard stay calm we&amp;#39;re okay what was that quiet that sounds like helicopters could be military but not ours how can you tell fourteen years in the navy what&amp;#39;s happening up there my guess those flashes that kicked this all off that was phase one take out your opponent&amp;#39;s population centers with big hits all at once fast and then for round two ground sweeps a satellite log showed an increase in coded traffic recently possibly extraterrestrial signals i bet what we just heard were airborne patrols sent to hunt down the remaining signs of life like us okay oh boy that&amp;#39;s bad and that&amp;#39;s worse what&amp;#39;s up there air filtration system i can&amp;#39;t something blocking the hatch if we can&amp;#39;t get it back on we&amp;#39;re gonna run out of breathable air fast you&amp;#39;re the only one small enough to reach it reach what the filtration system through there the main duct someone needs to get in there and restart it give me a hand let me go she&amp;#39;s not gonna know her way around the unit you won&amp;#39;t fit plus your arm she&amp;#39;ll be fine now to restart the unit you just swing the handle off then on off then on that should do it and neither of us will be able to go in and help you if you get stuck don&amp;#39;t get stuck michelle everything okay up there it looks like a dead end that&amp;#39;s the incline climb

that elsewhere today power has still not been restored to many cities on the southern seaboard in the wake of this afternoon&amp;#39;s widespread blackout while there had been some inclement weather in the region the problem seems linked to what authorities are calling a catastrophic power surge that has crippled traffic in the area no no damn okay okay please please please don&amp;#39;t hurt me please just let me go okay i won&amp;#39;t tell anybody i promise okay please just let me go please you need fluids you were in shock what are you going to do to me i&amp;#39;m going to keep you alive

please there is nowhere to go michelle i looked through your wallet given as how i saved your life i think that&amp;#39;s acceptable you&amp;#39;re lucky to be here at all what do you mean i found you and i saved your life by bringing you here i don&amp;#39;t understand i there&amp;#39;s been an attack what an attack a big one i&amp;#39;m not sure yet if it&amp;#39;s chemical or nuclear but down here we&amp;#39;re safe and where are we exactly underneath my farmhouse forty miles outside of lake charles i was driving north of here you were in an accident you were turned over on the side of the road i was driving by and i saw i saved your life michelle i couldn&amp;#39;t just leave you there okay well thank you so much for saving my life i guess i should go to a hospital now you can&amp;#39;t leave an attack means fallout which contaminates the air above ground that&amp;#39;s how it works how long do we have to wait until it&amp;#39;s safe depends on the proximity of the closest blast one year maybe two and that&amp;#39;s if we&amp;#39;re talking about weapons that we know of russians are developing some nasty stuff and if the martians finally figured out a way to get here their weapons will make the russkies&amp;#39; look like sticks and stones luckily i&amp;#39;ve prepared for this right well i&amp;#39;ll need to use your phone then to call my family and tell them that i&amp;#39;m safe here and make sure they&amp;#39;re okay michelle they&amp;#39;re not okay how do you know that everyone outside of here is dead but what about you don&amp;#39;t you have a family who&amp;#39;s that excuse me what did you do you know what michelle i&amp;#39;m gonna tell you what i told him you need to eat you need to sleep and you need to start showing me a little bit of appreciation my name is howard by the way oh god oh shit i&amp;#39;m sorry i&amp;#39;m sorry about that uh i didn&amp;#39;t mean to scare you are you um here you hungry so how are you doing you okay what is this it&amp;#39;s a bunker your room&amp;#39;s a little bit of a fixer upper but at least you got a door a scary door but you still got a door how long have you been down here couple of days i think you know it&amp;#39;s actually kind of hard to tell with no windows or sunlight or anything i mean how do we get out of here oh he didn&amp;#39;t tell you about getting out of here is the last thing you want to do because the air up there it&amp;#39;s contaminated i see you&amp;#39;ve met emmett what happened to him he did that to himself and his stumbling around isn&amp;#39;t helping anything what you heard earlier was him knocking over a shelf with a whole week&amp;#39;s worth of food which he&amp;#39;s sorry for correct totally let&amp;#39;s go bathroom time this is the common area good for r r as you can see i&amp;#39;ve planned for a long stay the aquaponics system cleans the air and keeps it fresh this is the living room help yourself to any reading if you like to watch films i have some on dvd and vhs cassette just make sure you put them back in their sleeve when they&amp;#39;re done the kitchen&amp;#39;s fully functional has an electric stove refrigerator freezer silverware and that table&amp;#39;s a family heirloom which means watch your glasses always use coasters and placemats keep your hands to yourself understand no touching take a seat this way this is my private space off limits unless i give express permission go ahead i don&amp;#39;t need to you will though and i&amp;#39;ve got to pace these things out so please i need privacy you&amp;#39;re welcome to close the curtain i can&amp;#39;t with you standing there and i can&amp;#39;t trust you not to burn this place down this is for my own safety i&amp;#39;m not some pervert just go don&amp;#39;t flush unless you&amp;#39;ve gone we can&amp;#39;t afford wasted flushes take a seat are you hungry those are megan&amp;#39;s she never went anywhere without two or three of those things who&amp;#39;s megan megan&amp;#39;s not with us anymore don&amp;#39;t worry just the generator maybe it&amp;#39;s a car outside that&amp;#39;s not possible i heard one earlier above my room if you had heard a car the driver would be long dead by now well shouldn&amp;#39;t we at least try to call the police or someone to find out what actually happened there&amp;#39;s no one left to call see that nothing&amp;#39;s coming through you think i sound crazy i mean it&amp;#39;s amazing you people you wear helmets when you ride your bikes you have seat belts in your cars you have alarm systems to protect your homes but what do you do when those alarms go off crazy is building your ark after the flood has already come i think maybe it&amp;#39;s time you met frank and mildred closest i could get to an airlock see what happened to them they weren&amp;#39;t as lucky as you it&amp;#39;s the air michelle that&amp;#39;s what happens when you get exposed i keep this door sealed at all times no one comes in or out met frank and mildred huh it&amp;#39;s funny right the whole world ends and the thing he&amp;#39;s most upset about is a pair of dead pigs you in need of some reading material i took all the quizzes sorry but i did learn how to do a french braid so you know if you want me to do that for you just let me know what do you know about him he was in the navy i know that i guess he did uh some stuff with satellites what kind of stuff satellite stuff well what brought him out here i&amp;#39;m not sure he bought this property a while back but i never paid much attention till he hired me to help him get this place set up the work was entertaining though that&amp;#39;s for sure you know howard&amp;#39;s like a black belt in conspiracy theory plus you know how often do you get hired to help build a doomsday bunker so he didn&amp;#39;t kidnap you no what about your arm weren&amp;#39;t you trying to escape i was trying to get in i watched howard build this place piece by piece for years he was always talking about you know possible attacks from al qaeda russia south korea you mean north korea is that the crazy one so yeah that one and uh you know poured all his money into this place took to it like his life depended on it which you know that stays with you so he told you all this while you&amp;#39;re building his bomb shelter and now he says that the air is contaminated and everybody&amp;#39;s dead yeah i know what you&amp;#39;re getting at but there&amp;#39;s more to it howard abducted me he drove me off the road and he dragged me here so whatever he&amp;#39;s telling you about the air some big attack the purpose of this shelter is a lie no no way the attack i saw it myself what do you mean i was on my way home from work and it looked like a flash bright red like an explosion from way far off it wasn&amp;#39;t like fireworks naw this was more like something you&amp;#39;d read about in the bible so what you saw what a flash of light lightning a fire that flared up i&amp;#39;m not explaining it right this wasn&amp;#39;t like anything i&amp;#39;d ever seen and so my first thought was to come here and when i got here howard was closing the door and i could see it right there on his face he knew something was happening something bad and so i fought my way in i heard a car right here above us you heard someone right above us that isn&amp;#39;t possible the air is what contaminated how do you know that because i told him dinner&amp;#39;s ready i see you two are getting along hmm how&amp;#39;s that sauce it&amp;#39;s fine as cooks go i&amp;#39;m okay not great but okay megan was a good cook you&amp;#39;ll learn to love cooking mmm mmm it&amp;#39;s delicious that&amp;#39;s the best sauce i&amp;#39;ve ever tasted are you being funny no i mean considering the alternative which is you know getting burnt up in a chemical attack or nuclear i&amp;#39;d say being alive and down here would make a fried turd taste pretty good so best damn sauce i ever had that&amp;#39;s not a bad point and please watch your language at table right you know what i haven&amp;#39;t been able to get out of my head for some reason ever since i got down here tattoos always wanted one but i never got any &amp;#39;cause everybody always said no no emmett you&amp;#39;ll never get a decent job if you do that whatever like that matters now right t ell you what if i had known this was coming i would&amp;#39;ve gotten like of them i swear man i would look like a circus freak or something i&amp;#39;d just be covered head to toe tattoos all over my you know

on the rocks little trick i taught myself as a young man stationed on a ship with way too much free time every now and again if the co was working us too hard we&amp;#39;d freeze and snap the knob off the bathroom door while he was still inside it usually took him an hour or two to get out i&amp;#39;m good suit yourself cheers ah this is clean all you need to do is stitch you&amp;#39;re doing fine some stuff i grabbed from your car i didn&amp;#39;t have time to bring in the booze sadly what is all that i wanted to design clothes no wonder you were so good with the stitches megan wanted to be an artist she was your daughter yes she was smart loved to read the magazines were just for fun she inhaled books anything with paris she liked their movies their culture you know we used to have this little joke every once in a while i&amp;#39;d ask her what do you want to be when you grow up you know what she&amp;#39;d say french anyway her mother turned her against me took her off to chicago people are strange creatures you can&amp;#39;t always convince them that safety is in their own best interest you don&amp;#39;t know they&amp;#39;re gone anyway at least i tried to help them hey there was nothing you could&amp;#39;ve done for that woman even if you let her in she still would&amp;#39;ve died you asked earlier about regrets yeah i&amp;#39;ve got some of those welcome to the club i mean i lived my life in a mile radius and that was by design i made sure that happened i was so fast in high school i even managed to outrun my bad grades i was all state track three years in a row caught a full ride to louisiana tech up there in ruston i remember i spent the last two weeks of that summer showing off the bus ticket they sent me to anybody who&amp;#39;d take a look at it and then came the night before i was supposed to leave and i just got so worried about how bad i was gonna do up there with all those smart kids so i went out of my way to get just piss wasted so bad that i knew there was no chance i was waking up in the morning so i missed the bus and i didn&amp;#39;t buy a ticket for the next one or the one after that well if you&amp;#39;d gone you might be dead now yeah lucky me right lucky us a few years ago i was at a hardware store and there was this little girl with her dad and he was in a hurry and she wasn&amp;#39;t keeping up so he kept yanking on her arm but really hard you know too hard i know that feeling when my dad got that way my brother colin was always there to take the worst of it for me and i thought seeing this little girl i thought maybe i could do that for her but i just kept watching and they&amp;#39;re about to leave and i&amp;#39;ve done nothing and she slips and it throws him off balance and he hits her and i wanted so badly to do something to help her but i did what i always do when things get hard i just panicked and ran look we&amp;#39;re here we&amp;#39;re alive and that means something it&amp;#39;s gotta you&amp;#39;ve got to be kidding me what we&amp;#39;re missing pieces here look at this poor cat he&amp;#39;s been deformed he&amp;#39;s got one eye he&amp;#39;s about to go snorkeling and everything too what are you doing ooh cornering the market on post apocalyptic fashion huh mmm hmm you need more axes and chain saws for what she has a shotgun yeah but what if up there it&amp;#39;s like what lumberjacks zombies though even howard doesn&amp;#39;t think that one&amp;#39;s plausible but you should hear his theory about mutant space worms what is that howard stay calm we&amp;#39;re okay what was that quiet that sounds like helicopters could be military but not ours how can you tell fourteen years in the navy what&amp;#39;s happening up there my guess those flashes that kicked this all off that was phase one take out your opponent&amp;#39;s population centers with big hits all at once fast and then for round two ground sweeps a satellite log showed an increase in coded traffic recently possibly extraterrestrial signals i bet what we just heard were airborne patrols sent to hunt down the remaining signs of life like us okay oh boy that&amp;#39;s bad and that&amp;#39;s worse what&amp;#39;s up there air filtration system i can&amp;#39;t something blocking the hatch if we can&amp;#39;t get it back on we&amp;#39;re gonna run out of breathable air fast you&amp;#39;re the only one small enough to reach it reach what the filtration system through there the main duct someone needs to get in there and restart it give me a hand let me go she&amp;#39;s not gonna know her way around the unit you won&amp;#39;t fit plus your arm she&amp;#39;ll be fine now to restart the unit you just swing the handle off then on off then on that should do it and neither of us will be able to go in and help you if you get stuck don&amp;#39;t get stuck michelle everything okay up there it looks like a dead end that&amp;#39;s the incline climb up that and you&amp;#39;re almost there ah this sucks what&amp;#39;s wrong howard he lied he lied about megan what do you mean i think he did something horrible to her no his family moved to chicago years ago what&amp;#39;s this is that blood here come with me wait that that&amp;#39;s not megan what do you mean yeah her name is brittany i remember her she went to high school with my little sister she she went missing two years back it was on the news and everything most people just thought she skipped town there was a message up there it said help it was scratched on the inside of the window and this earring this earring was with it did she ever show back up after she went missing he said to me he said to my face that this was his daughter he said this was megan he took her and he killed her all right let&amp;#39;s just think maybe we take away his gun tie him up get him to confess to whatever it is he&amp;#39;s done confess to who the police look like i said we can&amp;#39;t be the only survivors right the woman she was able to get around right at least a little yeah until she died directly above us making choking noises of all the people to save us now that was a great example of teamwork very well done i feel like some

the joust it&amp;#39;s very abrupt and i don&amp;#39;t understand the rules then i shall educate you a match is three lances one point is given for breaking a lance between the waist and neck two points for breaking on the helmet it&amp;#39;s difficult the helmet sweeps back most blows glance off three points for bearing a rider to the ground also if you bear a rider to the ground you win his horse do men die in the joust lance points are tipped with coronals which blunts them of course accidents happen i myself jocelyn have never been unhorsed nor have i your name lady i still need to hear it sir hunter you persist perhaps angels have no names only beautiful faces and you are i am um have you forgotten or your name is sir &amp;#39;&amp;#39; um&amp;#39;&amp;#39; ulrich von

charlemagne i first met him atop a mountain near jerusalem praying to god asking his forgiveness for the saracen blood spilt by his sword next he amazed me still further in ltaly when he saved a fatherless beauty from the would be ravishings of her dreadful uncle in greece he spent a year in silence just to better understand the sound of a whisper so without further gilding the lily and with no more ado i give to you the seeker of serenity protector of italian virginity the enforcer of our lord god the one the only sir ulrich von lichtenstein thank you thank you i&amp;#39;ll be here all

i&amp;#39;m through but i&amp;#39;ve never not finished before i wish to keep my honor intact a draw and colville is hurt colville withdraws ulrich advances why didn&amp;#39;t ulrich finish him he

without your heart you cannot win but her eyes concentrate tansy cakes count adhemar sends word he said he will win this tournament for you he&amp;#39;s won many he wins them for himself and his own honor it&amp;#39;s nothing to say he wins them for me he wishes to speak to you again not to hear a word i say adhemar wants his women silent would you have sir ulrich win the tournament for you no

now &#x27;cause i&#x27;m telling you i&#x27;ve never seen anything like him that&#x27;s exactly what i mean because of the way he&#x27;s lived uh he doesn&#x27;t seem to know what things are i mean things you and i take for granted common everyday objects simple ideas i just don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s ever been exposed to them i mean he&#x27;s about the most well read teenage kid you could ever meet but in other ways i think he&#x27;s a lot like a little child why you look like that you look like some kind of vampire from outer space or something they kick you out of cancer camp you got some kind of disease don&#x27;t look at me man did you hear what i said i don&#x27;t like your eyes what&#x27;s a new guy gotta do the first day he gets here he&#x27;s gotta do the due new guy first day

you go i don&#x27;t know what he is but retarded he&#x27;s not well aside from the absence of any and all body hair which is a condition not too uniquely uncommon bottom line he&#x27;s a very healthy young man in fact with all that farm work i&#x27;d say you&#x27;re in damn fine shape and the optometrist said his contact lenses will be here the end of the week they&#x27;ll be callin&#x27; him ol&#x27; blue eyes in time for the county fair you guys are comin&#x27; right uh you&#x27;ll see a few of us there hey doc thanks for comin&#x27; out it&#x27;s my pleasure good day mr jeremy reed jeremy listen uh i want you to think about something we attend school in town at wheaton high you certainly wouldn&#x27;t be at an intellectual disadvantage there and i know most of the teachers so anyway um all i&#x27;m saying is if you&#x27;d like to attend school one day next week i can arrange it will my contacts be ready by monday hey hey guys molecules when we speed up the course of molecules we get energy and um since we are all basically just a mass of molecules what does our brain send out to all the other parts of the body lindsey um impulses yeah electric impulses jeremy turn your head and look at lindsey yes that&#x27;s lovely that&#x27;s very good you&#x27;ve just relayed electricity your brain sent out an electric impulse down to your neck muscles and uh what what turned your head besides the obvious what your what your muscles used to turn your head it&#x27;s energy energy always relaying always transforming and never ending now looky here this is a uh a jacob&#x27;s ladder it&#x27;s a science fair toy and it&#x27;s uh built to show us how electricity travels okay can we get the uh shutters watch this ooh hey cut it out cut it out ooh look at this blinding isn&#x27;t it now who can tell me why electricity travels uh boredom huh he tickles me no no potential potential one side of this thing is positive while the other side has a strong negative pull and uh that&#x27;s all the potential that electricity needs to travel that&#x27;s right that&#x27;s pretty good don&#x27;t i bring you good entertaining things but you get the idea that it does you know it travels and just keeps going did you ever what&#x27;s your experience with electricity did you ever you know run your feet over a carpet like that and touch somebody what happens static electricity that&#x27;s right that&#x27;s right now where does it go when you touch somebody it just goes out so so so electricity like energy uh just um uh recycles it flows in a cycle that doesn&#x27;t end it uh are you all right mr ripley are you okay the local news and those channel people are outside so is jimmy hobbs from the newspaper tell them to go home oh come on doug they ain&#x27;t goin&#x27; anywhere till somebody goes out there and talks to &#x27;em tell them there&#x27;s no fatalities no sex scandal that will get rid of them fast god damn it doug i sound like a

him heart rate&#x27;s a little irregular but nothing to indicate the kind of electrical shock you&#x27;re talking about right right and he&#x27;s got a hole uh burned in his shirt the size of a bowling ball something&#x27;s happened here something&#x27;s happened here i&#x27;m telling you with everything we know about science about the makeup of the human body what happened in that classroom is impossible that kid attracted an arc of electricity from feet away and not just from the jacob&#x27;s ladder i mean after a second it was like it was comin&#x27; at him out of the whole building you want to know why there isn&#x27;t a hair on him why because he is electrolysis it can&#x27;t grow on him doc roth yes can i see you for a minute excuse me excuse me drink that in i will nobody saw

doesn&amp;#39;t seem to know what things are i mean things you and i take for granted common everyday objects simple ideas i just don&amp;#39;t think he&amp;#39;s ever been exposed to them i mean he&amp;#39;s about the most well read teenage kid you could ever meet but in other ways i think he&amp;#39;s a lot like a little child why you look like that you look like some kind of vampire from outer space or something they kick you out of cancer camp you got some kind of disease don&amp;#39;t look at me man did you hear what i said i don&amp;#39;t like your eyes what&amp;#39;s a new guy

like to attend school one day next week i can arrange it will my contacts be ready by monday hey hey guys molecules when we speed up the course of molecules we get energy and um since we are all basically just a mass of molecules what does our brain send out to all the other parts of the body lindsey um impulses yeah electric impulses jeremy turn your head and look at lindsey yes that&amp;#39;s lovely that&amp;#39;s very good you&amp;#39;ve just relayed electricity your brain sent out an electric impulse down to your neck muscles and uh what what turned your head besides the obvious what your what your muscles used to turn your head it&amp;#39;s energy energy always relaying always transforming and never ending now looky here this is a uh a jacob&amp;#39;s ladder it&amp;#39;s a science fair toy and it&amp;#39;s uh built to show us how electricity travels okay can we get the uh shutters watch this ooh hey cut it out cut it out ooh look at this blinding isn&amp;#39;t it now who can tell me why electricity travels uh boredom huh he tickles me no no potential potential one side of this thing is positive while the other side has a strong negative pull and uh that&amp;#39;s all the potential that electricity needs to travel that&amp;#39;s right that&amp;#39;s pretty good don&amp;#39;t i bring you good entertaining things but you get the idea that it does you know it travels and just keeps going did you ever what&amp;#39;s your experience with electricity did you ever you know run your feet over a carpet like that and touch somebody what happens static electricity that&amp;#39;s right that&amp;#39;s right now where does it go when you touch somebody it just goes out so so so electricity like energy uh just um uh recycles it flows in a cycle that doesn&amp;#39;t end it uh are you all right mr ripley are you okay the local news and those channel people are outside so is jimmy hobbs from the newspaper tell them to go home oh come on doug they ain&amp;#39;t goin&amp;#39; anywhere till somebody goes out there and talks to &amp;#39;em tell them there&amp;#39;s no fatalities no sex scandal that will get rid of them fast god damn it doug i

science about the makeup of the human body what happened in that classroom is impossible that kid attracted an arc of electricity from feet away and not just from the jacob&amp;#39;s ladder i mean after a second it was like it was comin&amp;#39; at him out of the whole building you want to know why there isn&amp;#39;t a hair on him why because he is electrolysis it can&amp;#39;t grow on him doc

style=width:0.8%&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt; 0.7% &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class&gt;&lt;td title=&quot;there&#x27;s a moment oforderly silence before a football play begins players are in position linemen are frozen and anything is possible almost indian summer weather here in mid november then like a traffic accident stuff begins to randomly collide from the snap of the ball to the snap of the first bone is closer to four seconds than five first and  riggins flea flicker back to theismann theismann&#x27;s in a lot of trouble one mississippi joe theismann the redskins&#x27; quarterback takes the snap and hands off to his running back first and  riggins two mississippi it&#x27;s a trick play a flea flicker and the running back tosses the ball back to the quarterback flea flicker back to theismann three mississippi up to now the play&#x27;s been defined by what the quarterback sees lt&#x27;s about to be defined by what he doesn&#x27;t four mississippi lawrence taylor is the best defensive player in the nfl and has been from the time he stepped onto the field as a rookie theismann&#x27;s in a lot of trouble and it was lawrence taylor who slammed theismann to the ground at the yard line the blitz was on he will also change the game of football as we know it we&#x27;ll look at it with the reverse angle one more time and l suggest if your stomach is weak you just don&#x27;t watch legendary quarterback joe theismann never played another down of football now y&#x27;all would guess that more often than not the highest paid player on an nfl team is a quarterback and you&#x27;d be right but what you probably don&#x27;t know is more often than not the second highest paid player is thanks to lawrence taylor a left tackle because as every housewife knows the first check you write is for the mortgage but the second is for the insurance and the left tackle&#x27;s job is to protect the quarterback from what he can&#x27;t see coming to protect his blind side the ideal left tackle is big but a lot of people are big he&#x27;s wide in the butt and massive in the thighs he has long arms giant hands and feet as quick as a hiccup this is a rare and expensive combination the need for which can be traced to that monday night game and lawrence taylor for on that day he not only altered joe theismann&#x27;s life but mine as well mr oher mr oher do you understand do you know why l&#x27;m here to investigate yes to investigate i&#x27;m here to investigate your odd  predicament do you find it odd your predicament michael i don&#x27;t know can l  can l

mike michael oher  gives us no reason to believe that    based on his records that he would be successful here well how bad could it be we&#x27;re not exactly sure how old he is due to his lack of records he has a measured lq of  which is sixth percentile his grade point average begins with zero   everyone passed him along they gave him d&#x27;s so they could hand their problem off to the next school he&#x27;s a brave kid for wanting to come here for wanting a quality education an education denied him by the poor quality of schools he&#x27;s attended most kids with his background wouldn&#x27;t come within miles of this place coach cotton we understand your interest in this young man&#x27;s athletic abilities he wouldn&#x27;t be able to play sports until he got his grades up forget sports look at the wall christian we either take that seriously or we paint over it you don&#x27;t admit michael oher because of sports you admit him because it&#x27;s the right thing to do class this is mike oher    and he&#x27;s new here so l expect you all to make him feel welcome mike just take any empty seat this is a quiz based on the information  you learned last year in your

what do you think we&#x27;re doing and don&#x27;t act like i&#x27;m going behind your back i know you put us down as michael&#x27;s medical contact at school there is a huge difference between paying for a broken arm    and being legally responsible for someone l mean a kid we barely know that&#x27;s another thing we need to find out more about his past he won&#x27;t talk about it he&#x27;s like an onion you have to peel him back a layer at a time not if you use a knife what if we took him to a child psychologist or something do you really expect big mike to  michael do you expect michael to lie on a couch  and talk about his childhood like he&#x27;s woody allen i mean michael&#x27;s gift is his ability to forget he&#x27;s mad at no one and he really doesn&#x27;t care what happened in the past you&#x27;re right excuse me you&#x27;re right  how&#x27;d those words taste coming out of your mouth like vinegar well at least promise me you&#x27;ll think about it all right all right

there&#x27;s very little on michael most of his files have been lost well what is in there a few case notes this one describes an incident where officers forcibly removed michael  from denise oher&#x27;s care when michael was  quite a scene evidently they had to split up the kids and it&#x27;s far from the worst where is she his mother i don&#x27;t know lf you find her we got a heap more files we could add to well how many kids does she have least a dozen probably lf not more with her drug arrest record my guess would be she can&#x27;t even remember can l see that so we would need her permission right no michael is a ward of the state just apply and get a judge to sign off on it so you would just give him away without even telling his mother man check out this piece right here man

this year i&#x27;m serious and that might not even be enough so he goes to a junior college unh uhn most inner city kids that go to jc drop out in the first year and his shot at the pros would go out

what i can do at ole miss we have the grove by the stadium we walk it before every game in front of thousands of people it&#x27;s a sacred ritual and l&#x27;m in front seen it a thousand times ever seen it from the front of the line next year you and me leading the team tennessee offered to let me run on the field and flip the coin i&#x27;ll throw in a sideline pass have you decided yet michael no miss sue but you like tennessee yeah that&#x27;s a good school not at the academic level of ole miss    but they have a outstanding science department you know what they&#x27;re famous for they work with the fbi    to study the effects of soil on decomposing body parts what&#x27;s that mean well when they find a body the police wanna know how long it&#x27;s been dead so the fine folks at tennessee help them out oh they have lots of body parts arms and legs and hands   from hospitals and medical schools and do you know where they store them right underneath the football field so while it&#x27;s fine and dandy to have  fans cheering for you  the bodies you should be worried about are the ones right under the turf set to poke up through the ground and grab you well it&#x27;s your decision where you wanna play ball don&#x27;t let me influence you all the other teachers are on board i don&#x27;t know what your problem is i&#x27;m sorry i will not give a student a grade he or she doesn&#x27;t deserve well michael needs a b what does he have to do to deserve that right now michael&#x27;s doing c minus d plus work his best chance at improvement is the written essay at the end of the year it counts for a third of the grade well that&#x27;s it we&#x27;re sunk why don&#x27;t you write about great expectations you&#x27;re a lot like pip i mean he was poor he was an orphan and someone kind of found him you should be able to relate to that fine we&#x27;ll go through the reading list but you&#x27;re gonna have to pick one michael pygmalion a tale of two cities the charge of the light brigade half a league half a league half a league onward i love that one he loves it why don&#x27;t you do this and l&#x27;ll watch basketball okay all in the valley of death rode the six hundred they named lsu&#x27;s stadium death valley because of this story alfred lord tennyson was writing about lsu ole miss you&#x27;re kidding no lt&#x27;s a great story lt&#x27;s a poem forward the light brigade that&#x27;s like the offense charge for the guns it&#x27;s the end zone into the valley of death rode the six hundred forward the light brigade was there a man dismay&#x27;d not tho&#x27; the soldier knew someone had blunder&#x27; someone made a mistake yeah their leader their coach but why would they go ahead if they knew he messed up theirs not to make reply theirs not to reason why into the valley of death rode the six hundred they&#x27;re all gonna die aren&#x27;t they yeah that&#x27;s really really sad i think you just found something to write about michael courage is a hard thing to figure you can have courage based on a dumb idea or a mistake but you&#x27;re not supposed to question adults or your coach or your teacher because they make the rules maybe they know best but maybe they don&#x27;t it all depends on who you are where you come from didn&#x27;t at least one of the guys think about giving up and joining with the other side i mean valley of death that&#x27;s pretty salty stuff that&#x27;s why courage is tricky should you always do what others tell you to do sometimes you might not even know why you&#x27;re doing something i mean any fool can have courage but honor that&#x27;s the real reason you either do something or you don&#x27;t it&#x27;s who you are and maybe who you want to be if you die trying for something important then you have both honor and courage and that&#x27;s pretty good i think that&#x27;s what the writer was saying that you should hope for courage and try for honor and maybe even pray that the people telling you what to do have some too kevin lin good job excuse me excuse me excuse me matthew nichols   hmm michael&#x27;s final gpa got it off of paul&#x27;s computer he did it sean he did it wait a minute you broke into the principal&#x27;s computer hmm michael oher michael where in the world did you find a baby picture of michael scanned it off an internet ad for a toddler boutique congratulations michael thank you michael up top way to go bro all right that&#x27;s enough young man l think l need a proper hug you&#x27;re gonna be staying in deaton hall where is it it&#x27;s  lt&#x27;s right there you&#x27;ll be on the meal plan so you&#x27;ll be eating over here in johnson commons johnson commons all you can eat self serve ice cream mm hm as much as you want that&#x27;s how mama put on her freshman  stop it whew hello this is mrs tuohy they just wanna ask you a couple questions michael you have nothing to hide mrs tuohy mr oher my name is jocelyn granger i&#x27;m the assistant director of enforcement for the ncaa please call me leigh anne so let&#x27;s do this shall we if you wouldn&#x27;t mind i&#x27;d prefer to speak with michael alone and how long is that gonna take a while it&#x27;s all right lt&#x27;s okay go on michael michael i&#x27;ll be waiting for you in the lobby all right l don&#x27;t know sean just have a bad feeling about this one this woman is tough tough tough tough tough hold on hey the client wants what were you aware that coach cotton was accepting a job at ole miss no and that this job offer came after you signed with them sean tuohy your legal guardian went to ole miss he played basketball and mrs tuohy went to ole miss as well she was a cheerleader is it safe to say that ole miss is their favorite school do they like any other universities what about say tennessee no they can&#x27;t stand tennessee and your tutor miss sue miss sue miss sue is an ole miss grad too miss sue ever try to persuade you to attend ole miss did you know that the tuohys make generous donations to ole miss that even miss sue makes donations that the tuohys they have a condo in oxford   so they can attend as many athletic events as possible that in fact both sean and leigh anne tuohy are by our definition boosters mr oher do you understand do you know why l&#x27;m here to investigate yes to investigate i&#x27;m here to investigate your odd  predicament do you find it odd your predicament michael i don&#x27;t know can l  can l leave now no you can&#x27;t what do you want ma&#x27;am l want the facts i need the truth l didn&#x27;t lie l wanna know what you think about this think about what the ncaa fears that with your recruitment    a door might be opened   that boosters from schools in the south  will become legal guardians of young athletes without means    and funnel them to their alma maters i&#x27;m not saying l believe it i&#x27;m not saying l don&#x27;t but there are many people involved in this case who would argue that the tuohys     they took you in they clothed you  no  they fed you they paid for your private education they bought you a car paid for a tutor   no no  all as part of a plan to ensure that you play football for the university of mississippi michael we&#x27;re not finished the toile&#x27;s not available like l told you months ago so why don&#x27;t we go with the ticking the low nap it&#x27;s a beautiful

mama you&#x27;re welcome why does she always do that she&#x27;s an onion michael you have to peel her back a layer at a time be right back what what michael i need a proper hug i read a story the other day about a boy from the projects no daddy in and out of foster care he&#x27;d been killed in a gang fight at hurt village in the last paragraph they talked about his superb athletic skills and how different his life might&#x27;ve been if he hadn&#x27;t fallen behind and dropped out of school he was years old the day he died it was his birthday that could have been anyone it could&#x27;ve been my son michael but it wasn&#x27;t and l suppose i have god to thank for that god and lawrence taylor one mississippi the new england patriots have traded the rd pick to the baltimore ravens and with the rd pick in the nfl draft    the baltimore ravens select michael oher offensive tackle mississippi &quot;&gt; there&amp;#39;s a moment oforderly silence before a football play begins players are in position linemen are frozen and anything is possible almost indian summer weather here in mid november then like a traffic accident stuff begins to randomly collide from the snap of the ball to the snap of the first bone is closer to four seconds than five first and riggins flea flicker back to theismann theismann&amp;#39;s in a lot of trouble one mississippi joe theismann the redskins&amp;#39; quarterback takes the snap and hands off to his running back first and riggins two mississippi it&amp;#39;s a trick play a flea flicker and the running back tosses the ball back to the quarterback flea flicker back to theismann three mississippi up to now the play&amp;#39;s been defined by what the quarterback sees lt&amp;#39;s about to be defined by what he doesn&amp;#39;t four mississippi lawrence taylor is the best defensive player in the nfl and has been from the time he stepped onto the field as a rookie theismann&amp;#39;s in a lot of trouble and it was lawrence taylor who slammed theismann to the ground at the yard line the blitz was on he will also change the game of football as we know it we&amp;#39;ll look at it with the reverse angle one more time and l suggest if your stomach is weak you just don&amp;#39;t watch legendary quarterback joe theismann never played another down of football now y&amp;#39;all would guess that more often than not the highest paid player on an nfl team is a quarterback and you&amp;#39;d be right but what you probably don&amp;#39;t know is more often than not the second highest paid player is thanks to lawrence taylor a left tackle because as every housewife knows the first check you write is for the mortgage but the second is for the insurance and the left tackle&amp;#39;s job is to protect the quarterback from what he can&amp;#39;t see coming to protect his blind side the ideal left tackle is big but a lot of people are big he&amp;#39;s wide in the butt and massive in the thighs he has long arms giant hands and feet as quick as a hiccup this is a rare and expensive combination the need for which can be traced to that monday night game and lawrence taylor for on that day he not only altered joe theismann&amp;#39;s life but mine as well mr oher mr oher do you understand do you know why l&amp;#39;m here to investigate yes to investigate i&amp;#39;m here to investigate your odd predicament do you find it odd your predicament michael i don&amp;#39;t know can l can l leave now no you can&amp;#39;t where&amp;#39;s coach cotton&amp;#39;s office thanks man they said you were the coach bert cotton tony hamilton but everybody just calls me big tony hey big mike check it out not even locked white people are crazy i promised my ma boo on her deathbed that l&amp;#39;d get my son steven out of public school and into a church school i appreciate that tony but i&amp;#39;m not involved with admissions i just figured maybe i can come talk to you seeing as though you might need some players what kind of sport does he play anything with a ball the boy&amp;#39;s good too classes start in a week it&amp;#39;d have to be for next semester i know what you&amp;#39;re thinking coach but look here l got money all right see l&amp;#39;m a mechanic at wilson&amp;#39;s auto the other side of town well look what if somebody drops out or moves could they get in then they you only mentioned one son that&amp;#39;s right steven but there&amp;#39;s another boy heh another boy yeah big mike sleeps on my couch from time to time it&amp;#39;s a bad deal you know his mom&amp;#39;s on that crack pipe he ain&amp;#39;t got nobody else he just wanted to come along for the ride they&amp;#39;re here yeah now the little one that&amp;#39;s steven and the big one big mike swish big mike ha ha come on mother of god steven hamilton&amp;#39;s paperwork looks acceptable to me and l believe he&amp;#39;ll do fine but this other kid big mike michael oher gives us no reason to believe that based on his records that he would be successful here well how bad could it be we&amp;#39;re not exactly sure how old he is due to his lack of records he has a measured lq of which is sixth percentile his grade point average begins with zero everyone passed him along they gave him d&amp;#39;s so they could hand their problem off to the next school he&amp;#39;s a brave kid for wanting to come here for wanting a quality education an education denied him by the poor quality of schools he&amp;#39;s attended most kids with his background wouldn&amp;#39;t come within miles of this place coach cotton we understand your interest in this young man&amp;#39;s athletic abilities he wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to play sports until he got his grades up forget sports look at the wall christian we either take that seriously or we paint over it you don&amp;#39;t admit michael oher because of sports you admit him because it&amp;#39;s the right thing to do class this is mike oher and he&amp;#39;s new here so l expect you all to make him feel welcome mike just take any empty seat this is a quiz based on the information you learned last year in your science curriculum don&amp;#39;t worry it&amp;#39;s not gonna be graded i just wanna see how much information we need to hit again just answer whatever you know thank you can l leave now yeah take your book l&amp;#39;m tired of having someone always in our home i&amp;#39;m tired of him eating all the food look man you gotta be christian about this thing let somebody else be christian about this thing dee come on l can&amp;#39;t kick him out on the street like he&amp;#39;s some dog let somebody else take the responsibility what you want me to go to beale street and drop him off when do l have time just to be with you all right all right whatever you win l&amp;#39;ll take care of it l don&amp;#39;t care if patrick ramsey approved the chair he&amp;#39;s an nfl quarterback not martha fricking stewart because there is a difference between bunny williams and a la z boy no see when mtv cribs comes to his house he&amp;#39;ll be showing off his home theater all i&amp;#39;m gonna see is a brown barcalounger no listen to me i&amp;#39;m the

i&amp;#39;m going behind your back i know you put us down as michael&amp;#39;s medical contact at school there is a huge difference between paying for a broken arm and being legally responsible for someone l mean a kid we barely know that&amp;#39;s another thing we need to find out more about his past he won&amp;#39;t talk about it he&amp;#39;s like an onion you have to peel him back a layer at a time not if you use a knife what if we took him to a child psychologist or something do you really expect big mike to michael do you expect michael to lie on a couch and talk about his childhood like he&amp;#39;s woody allen i mean michael&amp;#39;s gift is his ability to forget he&amp;#39;s mad at no one and he really doesn&amp;#39;t care what happened in the past you&amp;#39;re right excuse me you&amp;#39;re right how&amp;#39;d those words taste coming out of your mouth like vinegar well at least promise me you&amp;#39;ll think about it all right all right you&amp;#39;ll think about it

very little on michael most of his files have been lost well what is in there a few case notes this one describes an incident where officers forcibly removed michael from denise oher&amp;#39;s care when michael was quite a scene evidently they had to split up the kids and it&amp;#39;s far from the worst where is she his mother i don&amp;#39;t know lf you find her we got a heap more files we could add to well how many kids does she have least a dozen probably lf not more with her drug arrest record my guess would be she can&amp;#39;t even remember can l see that so we would need her permission right no michael is a ward of the state just apply and get a judge to sign off on it so you would just give him away without even telling his mother man check out this piece right here man

michael will need to make a gpa really his act is low and l don&amp;#39;t see it getting any better if he retakes it right there well what&amp;#39;s his gpa now that&amp;#39;s not bad when you consider where he started well he&amp;#39;s gonna have to make all a&amp;#39;s this year i&amp;#39;m serious and that might not even be enough so he goes to a junior college unh uhn most inner city kids that go to jc drop out in the first year and his shot at the pros would go out the window pros are we even sure he&amp;#39;s gonna get college offers michael nick saban from lsu looking forward

mike i promise you and for you sj this is what i can do at ole miss we have the grove by the stadium we walk it before every game in front of thousands of people it&amp;#39;s a sacred ritual and l&amp;#39;m in front seen it a thousand times ever seen it from the front of the line next year you and me leading the team tennessee offered to let me run on the field and flip the coin i&amp;#39;ll throw in a sideline pass have you decided yet michael no miss sue but you like tennessee yeah that&amp;#39;s a good school not at the academic level of ole miss but they have a outstanding science department you know what they&amp;#39;re famous for they work with the fbi to study the effects of soil on decomposing body parts what&amp;#39;s that mean well when they find a body the police wanna know how long it&amp;#39;s been dead so the fine folks at tennessee help them out oh they have lots of body parts arms and legs and hands from hospitals and medical schools and do you know where they store them right underneath the football field so while it&amp;#39;s fine and dandy to have fans cheering for you the bodies you should be worried about are the ones right under the turf set to poke up through the ground and grab you well it&amp;#39;s your decision where you wanna play ball don&amp;#39;t let me influence you all the other teachers are on board i don&amp;#39;t know what your problem is i&amp;#39;m sorry i will not give a student a grade he or she doesn&amp;#39;t deserve well michael needs a b what does he have to do to deserve that right now michael&amp;#39;s doing c minus d plus work his best chance at improvement is the written essay at the end of the year it counts for a third of the grade well that&amp;#39;s it we&amp;#39;re sunk why don&amp;#39;t you write about great expectations you&amp;#39;re a lot like pip i mean he was poor he was an orphan and someone kind of found him you should be able to relate to that fine we&amp;#39;ll go through the reading list but you&amp;#39;re gonna have to pick one michael pygmalion a tale of two cities the charge of the light brigade half a league half a league half a league onward i love that one he loves it why don&amp;#39;t you do this and l&amp;#39;ll watch basketball okay all in the valley of death rode the six hundred they named lsu&amp;#39;s stadium death valley because of this story alfred lord tennyson was writing about lsu ole miss you&amp;#39;re kidding no lt&amp;#39;s a great story lt&amp;#39;s a poem forward the light brigade that&amp;#39;s like the offense charge for the guns it&amp;#39;s the end zone into the valley of death rode the six hundred forward the light brigade was there a man dismay&amp;#39;d not tho&amp;#39; the soldier knew someone had blunder&amp;#39; someone made a mistake yeah their leader their coach but why would they go ahead if they knew he messed up theirs not to make reply theirs not to reason why into the valley of death rode the six hundred they&amp;#39;re all gonna die aren&amp;#39;t they yeah that&amp;#39;s really really sad i think you just found something to write about michael courage is a hard thing to figure you can have courage based on a dumb idea or a mistake but you&amp;#39;re not supposed to question adults or your coach or your teacher because they make the rules maybe they know best but maybe they don&amp;#39;t it all depends on who you are where you come from didn&amp;#39;t at least one of the guys think about giving up and joining with the other side i mean valley of death that&amp;#39;s pretty salty stuff that&amp;#39;s why courage is tricky should you always do what others tell you to do sometimes you might not even know why you&amp;#39;re doing something i mean any fool can have courage but honor that&amp;#39;s the real reason you either do something or you don&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s who you are and maybe who you want to be if you die trying for something important then you have both honor and courage and that&amp;#39;s pretty good i think that&amp;#39;s what the writer was saying that you should hope for courage and try for honor and maybe even pray that the people telling you what to do have some too kevin lin good job excuse me excuse me excuse me matthew nichols hmm michael&amp;#39;s final gpa got it off of paul&amp;#39;s computer he did it sean he did it wait a minute you broke into the principal&amp;#39;s computer hmm michael oher michael where in the world did you find a baby picture of michael scanned it off an internet ad for a toddler boutique congratulations michael

assistant director of enforcement for the ncaa please call me leigh anne so let&amp;#39;s do this shall we if you wouldn&amp;#39;t mind i&amp;#39;d prefer to speak with michael alone and how long is that gonna take a while it&amp;#39;s all right lt&amp;#39;s okay go on michael michael i&amp;#39;ll be waiting for you in the lobby all right l don&amp;#39;t know sean just have a bad feeling about this one this woman is tough tough tough tough tough hold on hey the client wants what were you aware that coach cotton was accepting a job at ole miss no and that this job offer came after you signed with them sean tuohy your legal guardian went to ole miss he played basketball and mrs tuohy went to ole miss as well she was a cheerleader is it safe to say that ole miss is their favorite school do they like any other universities what about say tennessee no they can&amp;#39;t stand tennessee and your tutor miss sue miss sue miss sue is an ole miss grad too miss sue ever try to persuade you to attend ole miss did you know that the tuohys make generous donations to ole miss that even miss sue makes donations that the tuohys they have a condo in oxford so they can attend as many athletic events as possible that in fact both sean and leigh anne tuohy are by our definition boosters mr oher do you understand do you know why l&amp;#39;m here to investigate yes to investigate i&amp;#39;m

need the truth l didn&amp;#39;t lie l wanna know what you think about this think about what the ncaa fears that with your recruitment a door might be opened that boosters from schools in the south will become legal guardians of young athletes without means and funnel them to their alma maters i&amp;#39;m not saying l believe it i&amp;#39;m not saying l don&amp;#39;t but there are many people involved in this case who would argue that the tuohys they took you in they clothed you no they fed you they paid for your private education they bought you a car paid for a tutor no no all as part of a plan to ensure that you play football for the university of mississippi michael we&amp;#39;re not finished the toile&amp;#39;s not available like l told you months ago so why don&amp;#39;t we go

know what saved napoleon&#x27;s life no his ego ego yes after he loses the battle of waterloo napoleon isolates himself on the tiny island of saint helena no one knows exactly what happens next but the version i like goes like this he&#x27;s very depressed and decides to take his own life but napoleon believes himself to be of such superhuman strength that he takes six times the amount of poison needed to do the job his stomach is so full up with poison that his body rejects it and he doesn&#x27;t die see ego saved his life maybe he need glasses glasses yes to read words on bottle poison

protect aliens who have a credible fear of returning to their own country if we can establish this fear with you then the cbp will be forced to begin expedited removal procedures to bring you to an immigration judge and let you plead your case for asylum asylum unfortunately the courts are so backed up with asylum cases that the soonest you&amp;#39;d get before a judge would be six months from now yes and we would have no choice but to let you go for those six months it&amp;#39;s the law you&amp;#39;d be released you would be free to wait in new york until your court date but believe it or not most people never show up before the judge so i go new york city uh huh you can go to new york city tonight but you only get to go if we can establish a credible fear fear mmm hmm fear from what

ego ego yes after he loses the battle of waterloo napoleon isolates himself on the tiny island of saint helena no one knows exactly what happens next but the version i like goes like this he&amp;#39;s very depressed and decides to take his own life but napoleon believes himself to be of such superhuman strength that he takes six times the amount of poison needed to do the job his stomach is so full up with poison that his body rejects it and he doesn&amp;#39;t die see ego saved his life maybe he need glasses glasses yes to read words on bottle poison it&amp;#39;s funny you should say that rumor

toradol to help with your pain please please just let me go please there is nowhere to go michelle i looked through your wallet given as how i saved your life i think that&#x27;s acceptable you&#x27;re lucky to be here at all what do you mean i found you and i saved your life by bringing you here i don&#x27;t understand i there&#x27;s been an attack what an attack a big one i&#x27;m not sure yet if it&#x27;s chemical or nuclear but down here we&#x27;re safe and where are we exactly underneath my farmhouse forty miles outside of lake charles i was driving north of here you were in an accident you were turned over on the side of the road i was driving by and i saw i saved your life michelle i couldn&#x27;t just leave you there okay well thank you so much for saving my life i guess i should go to a hospital now you can&#x27;t leave an attack means fallout which contaminates the air above ground that&#x27;s how it works how long do we have to wait until it&#x27;s safe depends on the proximity of the closest blast one year maybe two and that&#x27;s if we&#x27;re talking about weapons that we know of russians are developing some nasty stuff and if the martians finally figured out a way to get here their weapons will make the russkies&#x27; look like sticks and stones luckily i&#x27;ve prepared for this right well i&#x27;ll need to use your phone then to call my family and tell them that i&#x27;m safe here and make sure they&#x27;re okay michelle they&#x27;re not okay how do you know that everyone outside of here is dead but what about you don&#x27;t you have a family who&#x27;s that excuse me what did you do you know what michelle i&#x27;m gonna tell you what i told him you need to eat you need to sleep and you need to start showing me a little bit of appreciation my name is howard by the way oh god oh shit i&#x27;m sorry i&#x27;m sorry about that uh i didn&#x27;t mean to scare you are you um here you hungry so how are you doing you okay what is this it&#x27;s a bunker your room&#x27;s a little bit of a fixer upper but at least you got a door a scary door but you still got a door how long have you been down here couple of days i think you know it&#x27;s actually kind of hard to tell with no windows or sunlight or anything i mean how do we get out of here oh he didn&#x27;t tell you about getting out of here is the last thing you want to do because the air up there it&#x27;s contaminated i see you&#x27;ve met emmett what happened to him he did that to himself and his stumbling around isn&#x27;t helping anything what you heard earlier was him knocking over a shelf with a whole week&#x27;s worth of food which he&#x27;s sorry for correct totally let&#x27;s go bathroom time this is the common area good for r r as you can see i&#x27;ve planned for a long stay the aquaponics system cleans the air and keeps it fresh this is the living room help yourself to any reading if you like to watch films i have some on dvd and vhs cassette just make sure you put them back in their sleeve when they&#x27;re done the kitchen&#x27;s fully functional has an electric stove refrigerator freezer silverware and that table&#x27;s a family heirloom which means watch your glasses always use coasters and placemats keep your hands to yourself understand no touching take a seat this way this is my private space off limits unless i give express permission go ahead i don&#x27;t need to you will though and i&#x27;ve got to pace these things out so please i need privacy you&#x27;re welcome to close the curtain i can&#x27;t with you standing there and i can&#x27;t trust you not to burn this place down this is for my own safety i&#x27;m not some pervert just go don&#x27;t flush unless you&#x27;ve gone we can&#x27;t afford wasted flushes take a seat are you hungry those are megan&#x27;s she never went anywhere without two or three of those things who&#x27;s megan megan&#x27;s not with us anymore don&#x27;t worry just the generator maybe it&#x27;s a car outside that&#x27;s not possible i heard one earlier above my room if you had heard a car the driver would be long dead by now well shouldn&#x27;t we at least try to call the police or someone to find out what actually happened there&#x27;s no one left to call see that nothing&#x27;s coming through you think i sound crazy i mean it&#x27;s amazing you people you wear helmets when you ride your bikes you have seat belts in your cars you have alarm systems to protect your homes but what do you do when those alarms go off crazy is building your ark after the flood has already come i think maybe it&#x27;s time you met frank and mildred closest i could get to an airlock see what happened to them they weren&#x27;t as lucky as you it&#x27;s the air michelle that&#x27;s what happens when you get exposed i keep this door sealed at all times no one comes in or out met frank and mildred huh it&#x27;s funny right the whole world ends and the thing he&#x27;s most upset about is a pair of dead pigs you in need of some reading material i took all the quizzes sorry but i did learn how to do a french braid so you know if you want me to do that for you just let me know what do you know about him he was in the navy i know that i guess he did uh some stuff with satellites what kind of stuff satellite stuff well what brought him out here i&#x27;m not sure he bought this property a while back but i never paid much attention till he hired me to help him get this place set up the work was entertaining though that&#x27;s for sure you know howard&#x27;s like a black belt in conspiracy theory plus you know how often do you get hired to help build a doomsday bunker so he didn&#x27;t kidnap you no what about your arm weren&#x27;t you trying to escape i was trying to get in i watched howard build this place piece by piece for years he was always talking about you know possible attacks from al qaeda russia south korea you mean north korea is that the crazy one so yeah that one and uh you know poured all his money into this place took to it like his life depended on it which you know that stays with you so he told you all this while you&#x27;re building his bomb shelter and now he says that the air is contaminated and everybody&#x27;s dead yeah i know what you&#x27;re getting at but there&#x27;s more to it howard abducted me he drove me off the road and he dragged me here so whatever he&#x27;s telling you about the air some big attack the purpose of this shelter is a lie no no way the attack i saw it myself what do you mean i was on my way home from work and it looked like a flash bright red like an explosion from way far off it wasn&#x27;t like fireworks naw this was more like something you&#x27;d read about in the bible so what you saw what a flash of light lightning a fire that flared up i&#x27;m not explaining it right this wasn&#x27;t like anything i&#x27;d ever seen and so my first thought was to come here and when i got here howard was closing the door and i could see it right there on his face he knew something was happening something bad and so i fought my way in i heard a car right here above us you heard someone right above us that isn&#x27;t possible the air is what contaminated how do you know that because i told him dinner&#x27;s ready i see you two are getting along hmm how&#x27;s that sauce it&#x27;s fine as cooks go i&#x27;m okay not great but okay megan was a good cook you&#x27;ll learn to love cooking mmm mmm it&#x27;s delicious that&#x27;s the best sauce i&#x27;ve ever tasted are you being funny no i mean considering the alternative which is you know getting burnt up in a chemical attack or nuclear i&#x27;d say being alive and down here would make a fried turd taste pretty good so best damn sauce i ever had that&#x27;s not a bad point and please watch your language at table right you know what i haven&#x27;t been able to get out of my head for some reason ever since i got down here tattoos always wanted one but i never got any &#x27;cause everybody always said no no emmett you&#x27;ll never get a decent job if you do that whatever like that matters now right t ell you what if i had known this was coming i would&#x27;ve gotten like of them i swear man i would look like a circus freak or something i&#x27;d just be covered head to toe tattoos all over my you know everywhere face sure right there across my forehead just my name emmett or you know thug life yolo i don&#x27;t even know what that means but you know i hear people saying it all the time so it must be cool hey what about you howard anything you wish you&#x27;d done in all honesty no no no crazy nights in vegas maybe uh take a pilgrimage to waco everything i wanted to do i did i focused on being prepared and i was and here we are oh my goodness is that monopoly there we go yeah that&#x27;s how we kill the time what would you say howard we&#x27;re gonna be down here what like a year two maybe i bet you if we started a game right now we might even get halfway finished by the time stop talking you don&#x27;t need to make jokes about how long we&#x27;re going to be down here when nobody knows how long that&#x27;s going to be your humor is not funny i don&#x27;t appreciate it while i&#x27;m trying to eat and neither does michelle now please shut up and let us eat in peace hmm emmett would you pass me a napkin thank you i know what you&#x27;re saying i never could finish monopoly that game really does take forever right for me though it was um chutes and ladders uh sorry and trouble you know the thing with the dice and the thing that you pressed what was that called the pop o matic bubble yeah did you ever play that um what was that operation loved operation i&#x27;m telling you man i couldn&#x27;t play that game it terrified me why that noise that thing would make when you hit that edge i mean good lord it was pretty scary could you hand me the salt please ah shoot i&#x27;m sorry i&#x27;m gonna need the pepper also what exactly do you think you&#x27;re doing i&#x27;m asking for pepper like hell you were what was that i don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about howard are you trying to insult me here in the shelter that i built that&#x27;s keeping you alive you don&#x27;t think i see what you just did is that how you thank me for saving your life howard calm down shut up shut up and stay in your seat is it now let me tell you i know what a traitor looks like understand i have shown you nothing but generosity and hospitality i want you to apologize to tell me you&#x27;re going to behave i will you will what i&#x27;ll behave and i&#x27;m so sorry sit ah have to stay hydrated hmm that&#x27;s easy to forget down here what&#x27;s wrong nothing where are my keys michelle michelle stop give me those keys come on no don&#x27;t stop no no don&#x27;t don&#x27;t don&#x27;t open that door there&#x27;s a car there&#x27;s a car i see a car no here here here

your car your accident was my fault when i found out about the incoming attack i got frantic i knew i needed to get back here as soon as possible so i was driving like a maniac i tried to pass you and i&#x27;m the reason you went off the road i mean i know i seem like a sensible guy but at the time i wasn&#x27;t myself it was an accident but it was my fault i was afraid to tell you and i&#x27;m sorry um you should shower even the smallest amount of air that came through the hinges could be toxic these were megan&#x27;s if you want i recognized that woman&#x27;s car her name was leslie i think you knew her she was a neighbor emmett wasn&#x27;t the only one who knew about this place if any others somehow survived they could be coming here too as of friday kindness and generosity are antiquated customs i&#x27;m going to need some stitches what you want me to this is your doing isn&#x27;t it i mean i don&#x27;t think i&#x27;m really qualified i&#x27;ll walk you through it here have a drink what is it technically it&#x27;s vodka ah it&#x27;s safe i distilled it myself i just said i distilled it i didn&#x27;t say anything about it actually tasting good yeah that&#x27;s awful you want it on the rocks little trick i taught myself as a young man stationed on a ship with way too much free time every now and again if the co was working us too hard we&#x27;d freeze and snap the knob off the bathroom door while he was still inside it usually took him an hour or two to get out i&#x27;m good suit yourself cheers ah this is clean all you need to do is stitch you&#x27;re doing fine some stuff i grabbed from your car i didn&#x27;t have time to bring in the booze sadly what is all that i wanted to design clothes no wonder you were so good with the stitches megan wanted to be an artist she was your daughter yes she was smart loved to read the magazines were just for fun she inhaled books anything with paris she liked their movies their culture you know we used to have this little joke every once in a while i&#x27;d ask her what do you want to be when you grow up you know what she&#x27;d say french anyway her mother turned her against me took her off to chicago people are strange creatures you can&#x27;t always convince them that safety is in their own best interest you don&#x27;t know they&#x27;re gone anyway at least i tried to help them hey there was nothing you could&#x27;ve done for that woman even if you let her in she still would&#x27;ve died you asked earlier about regrets yeah i&#x27;ve got some of those welcome to the club i mean i lived my life in a mile radius and that was by design i made sure that happened i was so fast in high school i even managed to outrun my bad grades i was all state track three years in a row caught a full ride to louisiana tech up there in ruston i remember i spent the last two weeks of that summer showing off the bus ticket they sent me to anybody who&#x27;d take a look at it and then came the night before i was supposed to leave and i just got so worried about how bad i was gonna do up there with all those smart kids so i went out of my way to get just piss wasted so bad that i knew there was no chance i was waking up in the morning so i missed the bus and i didn&#x27;t buy a ticket for the next one or the one after that well if you&#x27;d gone you might be dead now yeah lucky me right lucky us a few years ago i was at a hardware store and there was this little girl with her dad and he was in a hurry and she wasn&#x27;t keeping up so he kept yanking on her arm but really hard you know too hard i know that feeling when my dad got that way my brother colin was always there to take the worst of it for me and i thought seeing this little girl i thought maybe i could do that for her but i just kept watching and they&#x27;re about to leave and i&#x27;ve done nothing and she slips and it throws him off balance and he hits her and i wanted so badly to do something to help her but i did what i always do when things get hard i just panicked and ran look we&#x27;re here we&#x27;re alive and that means something it&#x27;s gotta you&#x27;ve got to be kidding me what we&#x27;re missing pieces here look at this poor cat he&#x27;s been deformed he&#x27;s got one eye he&#x27;s about to go snorkeling and everything too what are you doing ooh cornering the market on post apocalyptic fashion huh mmm hmm you need more axes and chain saws for what she has a shotgun yeah but what if up there it&#x27;s like what lumberjacks zombies though even howard doesn&#x27;t think that one&#x27;s plausible but you should hear his theory about mutant space worms what is that howard stay calm we&#x27;re okay what was that quiet that sounds like helicopters could be military but not ours how can you tell fourteen years in the navy what&#x27;s happening up there my guess those flashes that kicked this all off that was phase one take out your opponent&#x27;s population centers with big hits all at once fast and then for round two ground sweeps a satellite log showed an increase in coded traffic recently possibly extraterrestrial signals i bet what we just heard were airborne patrols sent to hunt down the remaining signs of life like us okay oh boy that&#x27;s bad and that&#x27;s worse what&#x27;s up there air filtration system i can&#x27;t something blocking the hatch if we can&#x27;t get it back on we&#x27;re gonna run out of breathable air fast you&#x27;re the only one small enough to reach it reach what the filtration system through there the main duct someone needs to get in there and restart it give me a hand let me go she&#x27;s not gonna know her way around the unit you won&#x27;t fit plus your arm she&#x27;ll be fine now to restart the unit you just swing the handle off then on off then on that should do it and neither of us will be able to go in and help you if you get stuck don&#x27;t get stuck michelle everything okay up there it looks like a dead end that&#x27;s the incline climb up that and you&#x27;re almost there ah this sucks what&#x27;s wrong howard he lied he lied about megan what do you mean i think he did something horrible to her no his family moved to chicago years ago what&#x27;s this is that blood here come with me wait that that&#x27;s not megan what do you mean yeah her name is brittany i remember her she went to high school with my little sister she she went missing two years back it was on the news and everything most people just thought she skipped town there was a message up there it said help it was scratched on the inside of the window and this earring this earring was with it did she ever show back up after she went missing he said to me he said to my face that this was his daughter he said this was megan he took her and he killed her all right let&#x27;s just think maybe we take away his gun tie him up get him to confess to whatever it is he&#x27;s done confess to who the police look like i said we can&#x27;t be the only survivors right the woman she was able to get around right at least a little yeah until she died directly above us making choking noises of all the people to save us now that was a great example of teamwork very well done i feel like some music problem solving always puts me in a musical mood michelle you should go shower just in case sure i think i might have an idea ten better ways to style my bangs  no not the article this i think i can only make one but it&#x27;s a start no kidding what are you doing up i didn&#x27;t wake you up yet well i&#x27;m fixing your breakfast one egg over medium hey howard what is this you re watching sixteen candles pretty in pink it was one of megan&#x27;s favorite movies can i help you with something no no i&#x27;m just grabbing some water say um you know i was just thinking not that i&#x27;m trying to tell you how to run this place or anything i&#x27;m just a little curious michelle say how close do you think she got to that air filtration unit you think she touched it yeah i&#x27;m pretty sure she touched it well i know she cleaned up after and everything but i&#x27;m just thinking given that unit filters god knows what through from outside if she tracked anything back in with her it&#x27;d be pretty concentrated and i mean it could be all over the shower and the sink in your bathroom right now anyway it&#x27;s just a thought not bad so far partner if howard finds this he&#x27;s gonna kill us all right so we get the gun away from him all right we tie him up make sure he isn&#x27;t going anywhere and then one of us just goes out and looks for help um first word uh tiny small pygmy um little yep mmm hmm all right uh second word ooh michelle is a a girl a girl a child um a girl no she&#x27;s older see so she is a little princess  um no it was woman um little women wow little woman next time try being a little more specific let&#x27;s see here i&#x27;m always watching always um god i go wherever i want uh i mean well

exactly underneath my farmhouse forty miles outside of lake charles i was driving north of here you were in an accident you were turned over on the side of the road i was driving by and i saw i saved your life michelle i couldn&amp;#39;t just leave you there okay well thank you so much for saving my life i guess i should go to a hospital now you can&amp;#39;t leave an attack means fallout which contaminates the air above ground that&amp;#39;s how it works how long do we have to wait until it&amp;#39;s safe depends on the proximity of the closest blast one year maybe two and that&amp;#39;s if we&amp;#39;re talking about weapons that we know of russians are developing some nasty stuff and if the martians finally figured out a way to get here their weapons will make the russkies&amp;#39; look like sticks and stones luckily i&amp;#39;ve prepared for this right well i&amp;#39;ll need to use your phone then to call my family and tell them that i&amp;#39;m safe here and make sure they&amp;#39;re okay michelle they&amp;#39;re not okay how do you know that everyone outside of here is dead but what about you don&amp;#39;t you have a family who&amp;#39;s that excuse me what did

room&amp;#39;s a little bit of a fixer upper but at least you got a door a scary door but you still got a door how long have you been down here couple of days i think you know it&amp;#39;s actually kind of hard to tell with no windows or sunlight or anything i mean how do we get out of here oh he didn&amp;#39;t tell you about getting out of here is the last thing you want to do because the air up there it&amp;#39;s contaminated i see you&amp;#39;ve met emmett what happened to him he did that to himself and his stumbling around isn&amp;#39;t helping anything what you heard earlier was him knocking over a shelf with a whole week&amp;#39;s worth of food which he&amp;#39;s sorry for correct totally let&amp;#39;s go bathroom time this is the common area good for r r as you can see i&amp;#39;ve planned for a long stay the aquaponics system cleans the air and keeps it fresh this is the living room help yourself to any reading if you like to watch films i have some on dvd and vhs cassette just make sure you put them back in their sleeve when they&amp;#39;re done the kitchen&amp;#39;s fully functional has an electric stove refrigerator freezer silverware and that table&amp;#39;s a family heirloom which means watch your glasses always use coasters and placemats keep your hands to yourself understand no touching take a seat this way this is my private space off limits unless i give express permission go ahead i don&amp;#39;t need to you will though and i&amp;#39;ve got to pace these things out so please i need privacy you&amp;#39;re welcome to close the curtain i can&amp;#39;t with you standing there and i can&amp;#39;t trust you not to burn this place down this is for my own safety i&amp;#39;m not some pervert just go don&amp;#39;t flush unless you&amp;#39;ve gone we can&amp;#39;t afford wasted flushes take a seat are you hungry those are megan&amp;#39;s she never went anywhere without two or three of those things who&amp;#39;s megan megan&amp;#39;s not with us anymore don&amp;#39;t worry just the generator maybe it&amp;#39;s a car outside that&amp;#39;s not possible i heard one earlier above my room if you had heard a car the driver would be long dead by now well shouldn&amp;#39;t we at least try to call the police or someone to find out what actually happened there&amp;#39;s no one left to call see that nothing&amp;#39;s coming through you think i sound crazy i mean it&amp;#39;s amazing you people you wear helmets when you ride your bikes you have seat belts in your cars you have alarm systems to protect your homes but what do you do when those alarms go off crazy is building your ark after the flood has already come i think maybe it&amp;#39;s time you met frank and mildred closest i could get to an airlock see what happened to them they weren&amp;#39;t as lucky as you it&amp;#39;s the air michelle that&amp;#39;s what happens when you get exposed i keep this door sealed at all times no one comes in or out met frank and mildred huh it&amp;#39;s funny right the whole world ends and the thing he&amp;#39;s most upset about is a pair of dead pigs you in need of some reading material i took all the quizzes sorry but i did learn how to do a french braid so you know if you want me to do that for you just let me know what do you know about him he was in the navy i know that i guess he did uh some stuff with satellites what kind of stuff satellite stuff well what brought him out here i&amp;#39;m not sure he bought this property a while back but i never paid much attention till he hired me to help him get this place set up the work was entertaining though that&amp;#39;s for sure you know howard&amp;#39;s like a black belt in conspiracy theory plus you know how often do you get hired to help build a doomsday bunker so he didn&amp;#39;t kidnap you no what about your arm weren&amp;#39;t you trying to escape i was trying to get in i watched howard build this place piece by piece for years he was always talking about you know possible attacks from al qaeda russia south korea you mean north korea is that the crazy one so yeah that one and uh you know poured all his money into this place took to it like his life depended on it which you know that stays with you so he told you all this while you&amp;#39;re building his bomb shelter and now he says that the air is contaminated and everybody&amp;#39;s dead yeah i know what you&amp;#39;re getting at but there&amp;#39;s more to it howard abducted me he drove me off the road and he dragged me here so whatever he&amp;#39;s telling you about the air some big attack the purpose of this shelter is a lie no no way the attack i saw it myself what do you mean i was on my way home from work and it looked like a flash bright red like an explosion from way far off it wasn&amp;#39;t like fireworks naw this was more like something you&amp;#39;d read about in the bible so what you saw what a flash of light lightning a fire that flared up i&amp;#39;m not explaining it right this wasn&amp;#39;t like anything i&amp;#39;d ever seen and so my first thought was to come here and when i got here howard was closing the door and i could see it right there on his face he knew something was happening something bad and so i fought my way in i heard a car right here above us you heard someone right above us that isn&amp;#39;t possible the air is what contaminated how do you know that because i told him dinner&amp;#39;s ready i see you two are getting along hmm how&amp;#39;s that sauce it&amp;#39;s fine as cooks go i&amp;#39;m okay not great but okay megan was a good cook you&amp;#39;ll learn to love cooking mmm mmm it&amp;#39;s delicious that&amp;#39;s the best sauce i&amp;#39;ve ever tasted are you being funny no i mean considering the alternative which is you know getting burnt up in a chemical attack or nuclear i&amp;#39;d say being alive and down here would make a fried turd taste pretty good so best damn sauce i ever had that&amp;#39;s not a bad point and please watch your language at table right you know what i haven&amp;#39;t been able to get out of my head for some reason ever since i got down here tattoos always wanted one but i never got any &amp;#39;cause everybody always said no no emmett you&amp;#39;ll never get a decent job if you do that whatever like that matters now right t ell you what if i had known this was coming i would&amp;#39;ve gotten like of them i swear man i would look like a circus freak or something i&amp;#39;d just be covered head to toe tattoos all over my you know

amount of air that came through the hinges could be toxic these were megan&amp;#39;s if you want i recognized that woman&amp;#39;s car her name was leslie i think you knew her she was a neighbor

on the rocks little trick i taught myself as a young man stationed on a ship with way too much free time every now and again if the co was working us too hard we&amp;#39;d freeze and snap the knob off the bathroom door while he was still inside it usually took him an hour or two to get out i&amp;#39;m good suit yourself cheers ah this is clean all you need to do is stitch you&amp;#39;re doing fine some stuff i grabbed from your car i didn&amp;#39;t have time to bring in the booze sadly what is all that i wanted to design clothes no wonder you were so good with the stitches megan wanted to be an artist she was your daughter yes she was smart loved to read the magazines were just for fun she inhaled books anything with paris she liked their movies their culture you know we used to have this little joke every once in a while i&amp;#39;d ask her what do you want to be when you grow up you know what she&amp;#39;d say french anyway her mother turned her against me took her off to chicago people are strange creatures you can&amp;#39;t always convince them that safety is in their own best interest you don&amp;#39;t know they&amp;#39;re gone anyway at least i tried to help them hey there was nothing you could&amp;#39;ve done for that woman even if you let her in she still would&amp;#39;ve died you asked earlier about regrets yeah i&amp;#39;ve got some of those welcome to the club i mean i lived my life in a mile radius and that was by design i made sure that happened i was so fast in high school i even managed to outrun my bad grades i was all state track three years in a row caught a full ride to louisiana tech up there in ruston i remember i spent the last two weeks of that summer showing off the bus ticket they sent me to anybody who&amp;#39;d take a look at it and then came the night before i was supposed to leave and i just got so worried about how bad i was gonna do up there with all those smart kids so i went out of my way to get just piss wasted so bad that i knew there was no chance i was waking up in the morning so i missed the bus and i didn&amp;#39;t buy a ticket for the next one or the one after that well if you&amp;#39;d gone you might be dead now yeah lucky me right lucky us a few years ago i was at a hardware store and there was this little girl with her dad and he was in a hurry and she wasn&amp;#39;t keeping up so he kept yanking on her arm but really hard you know too hard i know that feeling when my dad got that way my brother colin was always there to take the worst of it for me and i thought seeing this little girl i thought maybe i could do that for her but i just kept watching and they&amp;#39;re about to leave and i&amp;#39;ve done nothing and she slips and it throws him off balance and he hits her and i wanted so badly to do something to help her but i did what i always do when things get hard i just panicked and ran look we&amp;#39;re here we&amp;#39;re alive and that means something it&amp;#39;s gotta you&amp;#39;ve got to be kidding me what we&amp;#39;re missing pieces here look at this poor cat he&amp;#39;s been deformed he&amp;#39;s got one eye he&amp;#39;s about to go snorkeling and everything too what are you doing ooh cornering the market on post apocalyptic fashion huh mmm hmm you need more axes and chain saws for what she has a shotgun yeah but what if up there it&amp;#39;s like what lumberjacks zombies though even howard doesn&amp;#39;t think that one&amp;#39;s plausible but you should hear his theory about mutant space worms what is that howard stay calm we&amp;#39;re okay what was that quiet that sounds like helicopters could be military but not ours how can you tell fourteen years in the navy what&amp;#39;s happening up there my guess those flashes that kicked this all off that was phase one take out your opponent&amp;#39;s population centers with big hits all at once fast and then for round two ground sweeps a satellite log showed an increase in coded traffic recently possibly extraterrestrial signals i bet what we just heard were airborne patrols sent to hunt down the remaining signs of life like us okay oh boy that&amp;#39;s bad and that&amp;#39;s worse what&amp;#39;s up there air filtration system i can&amp;#39;t something blocking the hatch if we can&amp;#39;t get it back on we&amp;#39;re gonna run out of breathable air fast you&amp;#39;re the only one small enough to reach it reach what the filtration system through there the main duct someone needs to get in there and restart it give me a hand let me go she&amp;#39;s not gonna know her way around the unit you won&amp;#39;t fit plus your arm she&amp;#39;ll be fine now to restart the unit you just swing the handle off then on off then on that should do it and neither of us will be able to go in and help you if you get stuck don&amp;#39;t get stuck michelle everything okay up there it looks like a dead end that&amp;#39;s the incline climb up that and you&amp;#39;re almost there ah this sucks what&amp;#39;s wrong howard he lied he lied about megan what do you mean i think he did something horrible to her no his family moved to chicago years ago what&amp;#39;s this is that blood here come with me wait that that&amp;#39;s not megan what do you mean yeah her name is brittany i remember her she went to high school with my little sister she she went missing two years back it was on the news and everything most people just thought she skipped town there was a message up there it said help it was scratched on the inside of the window and this earring this earring was with it did she ever show back up after she went missing he said to me he said to my face that this was his daughter he said this was megan he took her and he killed her all right let&amp;#39;s just think maybe we take away his gun tie him up get him to confess to whatever it is he&amp;#39;s done confess to who the police look like i said we can&amp;#39;t be the only survivors right the woman she was able to get around right at least a little yeah until she died directly above us making choking noises of all the people to save us now that was a great example of teamwork very well done i feel like some music problem solving always puts me in a musical mood michelle you should go shower just in case sure i think i might have an idea ten better ways to style my bangs no not the article this i think i can only make one but it&amp;#39;s a start no kidding what are you doing up i didn&amp;#39;t wake you up yet well i&amp;#39;m fixing your breakfast one egg over medium hey howard what is this you re watching sixteen candles pretty in pink it was one of megan&amp;#39;s favorite movies can i help you with something no no i&amp;#39;m just grabbing some water say um you know i was just thinking not that i&amp;#39;m trying to tell you how to run this place or anything i&amp;#39;m just a little curious michelle say how close do you think she got to that air filtration unit you think she touched it yeah i&amp;#39;m pretty sure she touched it well i know she cleaned up after and everything but i&amp;#39;m just thinking given that unit filters god knows what through from outside if she tracked anything back in with her it&amp;#39;d be pretty concentrated and i mean it could be all over the shower and the sink in your bathroom right now anyway it&amp;#39;s just a thought not bad so far partner if howard finds this he&amp;#39;s gonna kill us all right so we get the gun away from him all right we tie him up make sure he isn&amp;#39;t going anywhere and then one of us just goes out and looks for help um first word uh tiny small pygmy um little yep mmm hmm all right uh second word ooh michelle is a a girl a girl a child um a girl no she&amp;#39;s older see so she is a little princess

that way ah anyway you are taking me to see harvey i have been dying to meet him why is that his balls his autographed ones i&#x27;m a huge baseball fan oh right really oh yeah yeah no if i wasn&#x27;t an accountant i would be a major league scout i can tell you anything you want to know just by looking at somebody&#x27;s numbers huh for instance slugging percentage versus strike outs during spring training do you do you want to walk and talk maybe ah see the thing is it&#x27;s usually what we call in the trade a miscorrelation stan jacobson mr specter it is a pleasure stan it&#x27;s nice to meet you has mike oh my god oh my god is that them oh jeter hank aaron no way maris that&#x27;s not number  is it no but it was signed by tracy stallard big baseball fan stan why don&#x27;t you have a seat over here why don&#x27;t i uh get us some waters sorry i get talking about baseball i cannot stop well i know how valuable your time is i do do the books and speaking of which your assistant tells me you wanted to go over something from your last audit i could really use a water stan we&#x27;re not here to go over any accounting business you&#x27;re here because you&#x27;re being let go what it&#x27;s not going to feel as surprising when you understand why the firm looked into your background recently they know you lied about passing the cpa exam you were hired because of your outstanding credentials and the reality is they never existed i&#x27;ve been there for nine years my work has been nothing but i mean why would this even matter now you&#x27;ve been committing fraud your entire career the liability it presents no i don&#x27;t accept this take a deep breath once you go over the severance numbers you&#x27;ll see that we&#x27;ve been more than fair fair you think this is fair we understand how difficult this must be stan how you must feel right now you have no idea what i feel right now so i&#x27;m clear you&#x27;re not denying what we&#x27;re presenting you with you mean that i lied back when dreibach hired me no but i&#x27;m not some scam artist either i did go to college i just couldn&#x27;t afford to graduate no one ever questioned it before because i&#x27;m that good with numbers how did they find out all of a sudden they didn&#x27;t this background check is five years old what that doesn&#x27;t make sense is this the original yeah so tori knew all this time this is the same thing that happened to paula who paula discovered some undisclosed income the books weren&#x27;t adding up she brought it to me the next thing i know she is gone i asked tori about it then i started getting shut out of meetings they&#x27;re trying to hide something and they&#x27;re firing me so they can hey where are you going i&#x27;m not signing some agreement are you kidding me i&#x27;m getting railroaded should i go after him no you&#x27;ve done enough already so you let him leave physically restraining someone is not in my job description what about your associate the one who shared the background check that was a confidential internal document stan should have never seen it why did you even have it you didn&#x27;t expect us to fire him without proof did you tori&#x27;s right stan shouldn&#x27;t have seen it then i&#x27;m guilty of being thorough hey i still don&#x27;t understand why you haven&#x27;t told us the whole truth i mean if you knew five years ago why did you make it sound like this is something recent because it only came to my attention two days ago then who ordered the background check it&#x27;s routine you check with human resources is it routine for human resources to keep something from the ceo for half a decade what are you insinuating i think what harvey is saying is given how quickly we tried to accomplish this some of the details might have gotten lost what was also lost is that stan never signed the severance package which included the confidentiality agreement which means if he decides to make waves the whole point of avoiding negative publicity harvey will track down stan and make sure that he signs the severance package and the confidentiality agreement today you have my word thank you of course i&#x27;ll be in touch all right sweetie she&#x27;s lying she knew about stan she&#x27;s known for a long time and that matters to us why because she&#x27;s taking advantage of us we are being manipulated into firing one of her employees and told not to ask questions well i have questions and the answer is  as in million per year the amount of business dreibach generates for this firm which means you have to finish what you started find stan and get him to sign those documents oh and as far as i&#x27;m concerned that little associate of yours is to blame for all of this that was an honest mistake he knowingly revealed a client&#x27;s confidential document that is not a mistake how many more chances are you going to give that kid oh i didn&#x27;t realize we were keeping score but if that&#x27;s the case i still think he&#x27;s coming out ahead whatever you&#x27;re doing stop no you&#x27;re going to want to see this paula o&#x27;neil the former dreibach employee that stan mentioned she filed a wrongful termination suit that mysteriously went away really let me see that come with me wait do you not think something funny is going on you know what here&#x27;s what i think is going on you&#x27;re sympathizing with stan because you think he&#x27;s you that doesn&#x27;t mean that you need to learn something from what just happened not the least of which is how anyone no matter how valuable can be let go i can chalk up what happened with stan to youthful exuberance but jessica can&#x27;t so if you want to work here you better go home now because if she sees you wait wait is she going to fire me this habit of you empathizing with every client it&#x27;s not getting you anywhere you want to work in this firm you need to deal in facts evidence information that can hold up that&#x27;s what a real lawyer does stan did you follow me here it doesn&#x27;t take a sleuth to figure out that your next step would be to see another lawyer vople and williams they&#x27;re a good firm not the friendliest bunch if they called you that is against lawyer client privilege no one&#x27;s breaking any laws okay my assistant has a network of other assistants that tell her anything she wants to know like when someone calls for an emergency appointment you forgot this when you left i said i&#x27;m not signing anything it&#x27;s nothing to sign it&#x27;s a lawsuit you worked for dreibach for nine years oversaw clients filed hundreds of tax returns and fought audits now in light of your recently discovered fraud all of that can now be called into question therefore you&#x27;re being sued for nine years back pay plus any expenses incurred to mitigate the damage you&#x27;ve done this is this would bankrupt me or you can take what&#x27;s behind door number two it&#x27;s aberdeen who it&#x27;s not a who it&#x27;s a what dreibach is doing business with them and i think that&#x27;s where the problem was you don&#x27;t get it okay i&#x27;m only leaving with one of these and if it&#x27;s the lawsuit the first thing your friends upstairs are going to ask you for is a big fat retainer and when you tell them that harvey specter is the one that&#x27;s suing you you&#x27;re going to watch the color drain from their faces now what would you like to do this is not cool you leave me in your apartment all night and say you&#x27;re going to be right back you don&#x27;t even thank me for dropping off your suit i had a bad day jenny so you couldn&#x27;t call me i almost got fired okay what happened it it&#x27;s not worth explaining okay i need to find evidence that our accounting firm is up to something so i found this woman who filed a wrongful termination suit against them and she referred me to her lawyer did you call them yeah but they&#x27;re this huge firm unger and macy they wouldn&#x27;t take my call why not there&#x27;s a confidentiality clause in the settlement for one so so it means that they can&#x27;t share details like that yeah i thought all lawyers secretly shared that stuff you&#x27;re all in the same club right what that&#x27;s not a dumb thing to assume no no no no that&#x27;s not dumb at all because unger and macy have almost as many harvard grads as we do which means they&#x27;re going to be at the mixer tonight and there are two things that lawyers love to do drink and talk hi hi uh mike ross class of  ross i&#x27;m sorry i don&#x27;t have you on here do you have your id i can run it through the computer uh my harvard id what did you say your name was again michael ross of pearson hardman michael ross boy you think they ask harvey for his id when he comes to this place harvey specter you work with harvey specter uh yeah yes i&#x27;m his associate i can call him if you like just don&#x27;t tell him i gave you any trouble okay welcome thank you mmm oh god i&#x27;m never going to survive this deep breaths you&#x27;ll be fine hey i saw the signed severance papers on my desk thank you and i also left word for tori yes we spoke she&#x27;s relieved but i wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say completely forgiving you ever heard of aberdeen solutions dreibach listed them as a consultant firm they bill us every month for their management services okay what does that mean well check with accounting i did they can only tell me how much we pay them so i called aberdeen directly it&#x27;s an automated answering system i left six messages no returns stan mentioned it something just doesn&#x27;t feel right are you saying you want to investigate our client they&#x27;re also our accountants and tori is also a friend harvey if you got caught and didn&#x27;t i wouldn&#x27;t get caught i am explicitly telling you not to do this oh then i&#x27;ll let you know what i don&#x27;t find after i don&#x27;t look into it hey should we get the rest of the grads with us for a pic the rest this is only isn&#x27;t he from the class hey who is that guy no no i was  you&#x27;re not with us yeah rudy it&#x27;s mike you know we we hung out a bunch you where oh you know what maybe i&#x27;m thinking about somebody else sorry about that has anyone seen that guy here before will you excuse me hey i&#x27;m not having any luck i wish i could say different love but it&#x27;s been a potter&#x27;s field for me too what you get to pretend to be someone else i wanted to try it&#x27;s fun an accent hmm okay i&#x27;ll stop what you&#x27;re amazing and that&#x27;s brian jennings who&#x27;s brian jennings i saw his face on unger and macy&#x27;s website today what are you

her charisse honey uh this is one of my associates mike ross oh so nice to meet you hi and i&#x27;m in love with your date seriously she&#x27;s just been telling me about her work with monkeys it&#x27;s fascinating huh so really they&#x27;re as smart as us oh smarter i never had a chance with him i need to use the ladies&#x27; room would you excuse me monkeys aren&#x27;t smarter than humans i&#x27;m sorry well it depends on which humans you&#x27;re talking about i guess what huh name of case and rough date aberdeen v paula o&#x27;neil say six months ago let&#x27;s see says here that they were listed as a subsidiary of dreibach in a wrongful termination suit that&#x27;s it that&#x27;s what i&#x27;m looking for i can&#x27;t print this out it&#x27;ll get tagged come around and take a look is that what you were after yeah that&#x27;s it but what&#x27;s that that links to another court filing in relation to aberdeen click on it says here that they filed for dissolution earlier today the whole company that&#x27;s what it says they&#x27;re officially shut down i&#x27;m going to need one more favor i think it&#x27;s great that you found someone not in law who works out in the real world why do you say that because i&#x27;m stuck in a suit all day or an office or a courtroom i think it would be nice to be in nature don&#x27;t you mike well i love that you&#x27;re a lawyer in fact i&#x27;d love to see where you work sometimes you would i&#x27;m not feeling so well all of a sudden no yeah do you think we can go yeah right now now yeah so great to meet you lovely to meet you have a good night yeah bye bye okay why didn&#x27;t you do that sooner &#x27;cause i had to get this first that&#x27;s the guy right from the firm that&#x27;s his employee id he gave this to you no i stole it what listen you can spend all night trying to get to the guy or you could just go into his firm yourself and look come on let&#x27;s go yeah i can barely keep my eyes open myself they got me filing briefs sucks you actually came you must be harvey specter joe was it your friend fill you in on the deal that&#x27;s on the table let me just get it straight you caught him rifling through some files and in lieu of calling the police you want me to pay you off i never said that he did oh that&#x27;s great this way if i level a charge of extortion it&#x27;s hearsay huh ten years working for a law firm you learn a thing or two which is good &#x27;cause you sure as hell don&#x27;t make a lot of money doing it somehow i think you&#x27;re getting by fine just say i know the level you guys play at espionage happens all the time which is why i know you&#x27;ll do anything to protect your secrets well actually joe spina of clover lane in astoria queens i think we all would like those tax returns you filed jointly for the last six years while no longer living with your wife you know the irs can destroy you for that you think you&#x27;re the first person to try to extort me joe because that&#x27;s the level i play at now you&#x27;re a security guard who likes to take risks i like that so here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re going to do this here is a generous donation to joey junior&#x27;s little league team now if it gets to them it gets to them if it doesn&#x27;t it doesn&#x27;t but the next time we talk it&#x27;s going to be me who wants a favor officer do i really need to pay you back let&#x27;s start with an explanation you said i needed to find evidence so i went to find some by breaking into another law firm is that really worse than paying off a security guard okay first of all i didn&#x27;t pay him off second of all if i hadn&#x27;t paid him off you&#x27;d be in jail right now you think i might be right about stan no i never said you were wrong i said we needed evidence what did you find something dreibach bought a shelf company months ago what&#x27;s a shelf company it&#x27;s a corporation that exists only on paper so its owners can hide their assets isn&#x27;t that a shell company no it&#x27;s a shelf company okay take a shell company give it a bank account credit history tax returns and let it season for years on a shelf someone buys it slots their name into it and they walk away with an established corporation with a pre existing history anyone looks any closer you shut it down and do it again that&#x27;s legal shelf companies are legal i&#x27;m guessing what tori&#x27;s doing with hers isn&#x27;t wait a minute is it called aberdeen yeah i saw it on the top of this list with other management companies all related to dreibach in that wrongful termination suit when we get back to the office i want you to find legal precedent that will allow us to subpoena those records okay on it but do i really have to pay you back every penny wait a minute how much was in that envelope hey what are you all doing in my desk dude you gotta check this out excuse me excuse me is that louis uh huh in the lobby is this a security camera a live feed what are you guys doing no this is from last night the guys in security emailed it up to louis this morning and why are we watching it on my computer well we&#x27;re not going to risk watching it on one of ours and everyone knows your password how does everybody know my password ross  how hard is that to crack okay  increases the odds okay shh here it comes oh what oh oh no what did he say to her evidently louis wants a restraining order and he needs this as evidence what uh um okay listen please don&#x27;t i came in here and it look i are you okay down louis if the message you left was another trick to get me down here no tricks i assure you come on in stan i&#x27;m jessica pearson oh yeah i know who you are you said if i accepted the severance agreement there wouldn&#x27;t be a lawsuit well there is one but not against you with you we know about aberdeen we know what tori was orchestrating and with your help we can expose her why should i help you what have you got to lose tell me what you need me to do hey what does he have you trying to find this time you really want to know uh i managed to get a look at some files involving our accounting firm what&#x27;s up with our accounting firm they&#x27;re stealing from us you know your phone bill you have all those surcharges you have no idea what they mean but you pay them anyway yeah yeah well dreibach&#x27;s doing the same thing to us except all their charges are a complete scam pretty sure the phone charges are a scam too yeah maybe so what do you need i need a legal reason to get those files without saying i saw those files you need them for court or you just need them why well you said you read them right yeah so then you already have them in here you&#x27;re right i do yes so you dictate i&#x27;ll type what you&#x27;d actually do that for me they&#x27;re stealing from us pearson hardman is my firm too come on okay with the party of the third part hereto referred to as norton llc rendered to not the subject of any litigation or any claim that might be reasonably anticipated to give rise being acknowledged that such appointment is irrevocable and shall be deemed a power coupled with lawfully invested with the power to make such contracts or to perform acts from which it may be lawfully implied that&#x27;s it did we get it saving and wait for it done what your mind it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s

it&#x27;s it&#x27;s impossible to have anything long term unless you find someone that has the same hour work week and then that doesn&#x27;t work either because they&#x27;re busy too yeah well i&#x27;m not going to let that be the reason that jenny and i don&#x27;t what are you two still doing here uh it&#x27;s for harvey nothing uh but we&#x27;re done goodnight yeah i&#x27;ll see you later goodnight bye bye i&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re aware of this but um i&#x27;m just going to remind you anyway um this office frowns upon relationships in the workplace yeah watch it oh god i&#x27;m so

i said i was on my way save it those the files yes take them please stan is in my office meet us in the conference room okay sorry to keep you waiting that&#x27;s okay i got your email with the list of other law firms i respect your effort to make amends by referring new clients oh that wasn&#x27;t a list for client referrals those were firms you should consider for representation we&#x27;re no longer your attorneys tori what we have no choice really it would be impossible to represent you when we plan on suing you for every penny you&#x27;ve got is this a joke aberdeen solutions created in june of  sold to dreibach in  dissolved two days ago before that it was bolton finances and before that it was norton services littleton llc where did you get those we know what you did tori you couldn&#x27;t have subpoenaed these files and yet we have them take a look they&#x27;re all there and now we have proof proof of what those are all legitimate corporations used for stealing money and lining your own pockets but don&#x27;t take my word for it guys hello tori yeah we hired stan to do a little independent consulting on our behalf and he&#x27;s come up with some very interesting connections it was easy even if i don&#x27;t really have a degree there was that vacation you invited me on last year to your new house in the bahamas a house you bought with money you stole from this firm my firm jessica jessica what you can&#x27;t use any of this we have attorney client privilege with dreibach accounting yes with the shelf companies no and unfortunately for you you&#x27;re listed on the shelf companies you stole from me you either come clean now or the only time you&#x27;ll see your children in the next decade will be during prison visiting hours so i&#x27;m going to get my job back now right i don&#x27;t see why not no stan you&#x27;re not what dreibach&#x27;s going bankrupt after this all shakes out even if they don&#x27;t they&#x27;re not going to hire you back why because you falsified your resume what am i supposed to do now well we just got you more than your severance package i suggest you use it to tide yourself over until you figure something out stan hey your best asset is your mind they can&#x27;t take that from you one little mistake you could go back to school become legitimate start over i never should have done it i told you they wouldn&#x27;t catch me what are you looking for harvey positive reinforcement nothing major a trophy nobel would your likeness in bronze in the lobby be okay bust or life size you did a good thing harvey but it wasn&#x27;t just me you know well then i guess i should give the kid the benefit of the doubt from now on you should well you&#x27;ll be happy to know that stan has no idea what he&#x27;s going to do with the rest of his life that doesn&#x27;t make me happy what if i tell you i have no idea what i&#x27;m doing with mine what the hell are we going to do when i get caught harvey you&#x27;re not going to get caught that&#x27;s your answer what else is there why what hire me why would you do that to me you mean for you no i don&#x27;t you&#x27;ve made it perfectly clear that you only do things for yourself so why you mean the reason why i became a lawyer or your friend dealt drugs or you used to cheat i cheated because i need to you couldn&#x27;t make money any other way bullshit life is this i like this that&#x27;s not me well if it wasn&#x27;t me you wouldn&#x27;t be here so if you want this to stop all you gotta do is tap out hello oh you&#x27;re here to see mike we&#x27;re going to celebrate his victory ah you know i actually think that it&#x27;s a really really good idea that you&#x27;ve come to pick him up in fact if i were you i&#x27;d do it a little more often just all those late nights working with rachel what do you mean what do i oh come on you&#x27;re a smart girl you understand animal behavior i think you can figure it out hey you ready yeah&quot;&gt;

called sparkling wine and i don&amp;#39;t really drink sparkling wine forget it forgive him his parents really wanted a girl never got over it wait a minute you can taste the difference i&amp;#39;m

autographed ones i&amp;#39;m a huge baseball fan oh right really oh yeah yeah no if i wasn&amp;#39;t an accountant i would be a major league scout i can tell you anything you want to know just by looking at somebody&amp;#39;s numbers huh for instance slugging percentage versus strike outs during spring training do you do you want to walk and talk maybe ah see the thing is it&amp;#39;s usually what we call in the trade a miscorrelation stan jacobson mr specter it is a pleasure stan it&amp;#39;s nice to meet you has mike oh my god oh my god is that them oh jeter hank aaron no way maris that&amp;#39;s not number is it no but it was signed by tracy stallard big baseball fan stan why don&amp;#39;t you have a seat over here why don&amp;#39;t i uh get us some waters sorry i get talking about baseball i cannot stop well i know how valuable your time is i do do the books and speaking of which your assistant tells me you wanted to go over something from your last audit i could really use a water stan we&amp;#39;re not here to go over any accounting business you&amp;#39;re here because you&amp;#39;re being let go what it&amp;#39;s not going to feel as surprising when you understand why the firm looked into your background recently they know you lied about passing the cpa exam you were hired because of your outstanding credentials and the reality is they never existed i&amp;#39;ve been there for nine years my work has been nothing but i mean why would this even matter now you&amp;#39;ve been committing fraud your entire career the liability it presents no i don&amp;#39;t accept this take a deep breath once you go over the severance numbers you&amp;#39;ll see that we&amp;#39;ve been more than fair fair you think this is fair we understand how difficult this must be stan how you must feel right now you have no idea what i feel right now so i&amp;#39;m clear you&amp;#39;re not denying what we&amp;#39;re presenting you with you mean that i lied back when dreibach hired me no but i&amp;#39;m not some scam artist either i did go to college i just couldn&amp;#39;t afford to graduate no one ever questioned it before because i&amp;#39;m that good with numbers how did they find out all of a sudden they didn&amp;#39;t this background check is five years old what that doesn&amp;#39;t make sense is this the original yeah so tori knew all this time this is the same thing that happened to paula who paula discovered some undisclosed income the books weren&amp;#39;t adding up she brought it to me the next thing i know she is gone i asked tori about it then i started getting shut out of meetings they&amp;#39;re trying to hide something and they&amp;#39;re firing me so they can hey where are you going i&amp;#39;m not signing some agreement are you kidding me i&amp;#39;m getting railroaded should i go after him no you&amp;#39;ve done enough already so you let him leave physically restraining someone is not in my job description what about your associate the one who shared the background check that was a confidential internal document stan should have never seen it why did you even have it you didn&amp;#39;t expect us to fire him without proof did you tori&amp;#39;s right stan shouldn&amp;#39;t have seen it then i&amp;#39;m guilty of being thorough hey i still don&amp;#39;t understand why you haven&amp;#39;t told us the whole truth i mean if you knew five years ago why did you make it sound like this is something recent because it only came to my attention two days ago then who ordered the background check it&amp;#39;s routine you check with human resources is it routine for human resources to keep something from the ceo for half a decade what are you insinuating i think what harvey is saying is given how quickly we tried to accomplish this some of the details might have gotten lost what was also lost is that stan never signed the severance package which included the confidentiality agreement which means if he decides to make waves the whole point of avoiding negative publicity harvey will track down stan and make sure that he signs the severance package and the confidentiality agreement today you have my word thank you of course i&amp;#39;ll be in touch all right sweetie she&amp;#39;s lying she knew about stan she&amp;#39;s known for a long time and that matters to us why because she&amp;#39;s taking advantage of us we are being manipulated into firing one of her employees and told not to ask questions well i have questions and the answer is as in million per year the amount of business dreibach generates for this firm which means you have to finish what you started find stan and get him to sign those documents oh and as far as i&amp;#39;m concerned that little associate of yours is to blame for all of this that was an honest mistake he knowingly revealed a client&amp;#39;s confidential document that is not a mistake how many more chances are you going to give that kid oh i didn&amp;#39;t realize we were keeping score but if that&amp;#39;s the case i still think he&amp;#39;s coming out ahead whatever you&amp;#39;re doing stop no you&amp;#39;re going to want to see this paula o&amp;#39;neil the former dreibach employee that stan mentioned she filed a wrongful termination suit that mysteriously went away really let me see that come with me wait do you not think something funny is going on you know what here&amp;#39;s what i think is going on you&amp;#39;re sympathizing with stan because you think he&amp;#39;s you that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that you need to learn something from what just happened not the least of which is how anyone no matter how valuable can be let go i can chalk up what happened with stan to youthful exuberance but jessica can&amp;#39;t so if you want to work here you better go home now because if she sees you wait wait is she going to fire me this habit of you empathizing with every client it&amp;#39;s not getting you anywhere you want to work in this firm you need to deal in facts evidence information that can hold up that&amp;#39;s what a real lawyer does stan did you follow me here it doesn&amp;#39;t take a sleuth to figure out that your next step would be to see another lawyer vople and williams they&amp;#39;re a good firm not the friendliest bunch if they called you that is against lawyer client privilege no one&amp;#39;s breaking any laws okay my assistant has a network of other assistants that tell her anything she wants to know like when someone calls for an emergency appointment you forgot this when you left i said i&amp;#39;m not signing anything it&amp;#39;s nothing to sign it&amp;#39;s a lawsuit you worked for dreibach for nine years oversaw clients filed hundreds of tax returns and fought audits now in light of your recently discovered fraud all of that can now be called into question therefore you&amp;#39;re being sued for nine years back pay plus any expenses incurred to mitigate the damage you&amp;#39;ve done this is this would bankrupt me or you can take what&amp;#39;s behind door number two it&amp;#39;s aberdeen who it&amp;#39;s not a who it&amp;#39;s a what dreibach is doing business with them and i think that&amp;#39;s where the problem was you don&amp;#39;t get it okay i&amp;#39;m only leaving with one of these and if it&amp;#39;s the lawsuit the first thing your friends upstairs are going to ask you for is a big fat retainer and when you tell them that harvey specter is the one that&amp;#39;s suing you you&amp;#39;re going to watch the color drain from their faces now what would you like to do this is not cool you leave me in your apartment all night and say you&amp;#39;re going to be right back you don&amp;#39;t even thank me for dropping off your suit i had a bad day jenny so you couldn&amp;#39;t call me i almost got fired okay what happened it it&amp;#39;s not worth explaining okay i need to find evidence that our accounting firm is up to something so i found this woman who filed a wrongful termination suit against them and she referred me to her lawyer did you call them yeah but they&amp;#39;re this huge firm unger and macy they wouldn&amp;#39;t take my call why not there&amp;#39;s a confidentiality clause in the settlement for one so so it means that they can&amp;#39;t share details like that yeah i thought all lawyers secretly shared that stuff you&amp;#39;re all in the same club right what that&amp;#39;s not a dumb thing to assume no no no no that&amp;#39;s not dumb at all because unger and macy have almost as many harvard grads as we do which means they&amp;#39;re going to be at the mixer tonight and there are two things that lawyers love to do drink and talk hi hi uh mike ross class of ross i&amp;#39;m sorry i don&amp;#39;t have you on here do you have your id i can run it through the computer uh my harvard id what did you say your name was again michael ross of pearson hardman michael ross boy you think they ask harvey for his id when he comes to this place harvey specter you work with harvey specter uh yeah yes i&amp;#39;m his associate i can call him if you like just don&amp;#39;t tell him i gave you any trouble okay welcome thank you mmm oh god i&amp;#39;m never going to survive this deep breaths you&amp;#39;ll be fine hey i saw the signed severance papers on my desk thank you and i also left word for tori yes we spoke she&amp;#39;s relieved but i wouldn&amp;#39;t go so far as to say completely forgiving you ever heard of aberdeen solutions dreibach listed them as a consultant firm they bill us every month for their management services okay what does that mean well check with accounting i did they can only tell me how much we pay them so i called aberdeen directly it&amp;#39;s an automated answering system i left six messages no returns stan mentioned it something just doesn&amp;#39;t feel right are you saying you want to investigate our client they&amp;#39;re also our accountants and tori is also a friend harvey if you got caught and didn&amp;#39;t i wouldn&amp;#39;t get caught i am explicitly telling you not to do this oh then i&amp;#39;ll let you know what i don&amp;#39;t find after i don&amp;#39;t look into it hey should we get the rest of the grads with us for a pic the rest this is only isn&amp;#39;t he from the class hey who is that guy no no i was you&amp;#39;re not with us yeah rudy

i&amp;#39;m not having any luck i wish i could say different love but it&amp;#39;s been a potter&amp;#39;s field for me too what you get to pretend to be someone else i wanted to try it&amp;#39;s fun an accent hmm okay i&amp;#39;ll stop what you&amp;#39;re amazing and that&amp;#39;s brian jennings who&amp;#39;s brian jennings i saw his face on unger and macy&amp;#39;s website today what are you

months ago let&amp;#39;s see says here that they were listed as a subsidiary of dreibach in a wrongful termination suit that&amp;#39;s it that&amp;#39;s what i&amp;#39;m looking for i can&amp;#39;t print this out it&amp;#39;ll get tagged come around and take a look is that what you were after yeah that&amp;#39;s it but what&amp;#39;s that that links to another court filing in relation to aberdeen click on it says here that they filed for dissolution earlier today the whole company that&amp;#39;s what it says they&amp;#39;re officially shut down i&amp;#39;m going to need one more favor i think it&amp;#39;s great that you found someone not in law who works out in the real world why do you say that because i&amp;#39;m stuck in a suit all day or an office or a courtroom i think it would be nice to be in nature don&amp;#39;t you mike well i love that you&amp;#39;re a lawyer in fact i&amp;#39;d love to see where you work sometimes you would i&amp;#39;m not feeling so well all of a sudden no yeah do you think we can go yeah right now now yeah so great to meet you lovely to meet you have a good night yeah bye bye okay why didn&amp;#39;t you do that sooner &amp;#39;cause i had to get this first that&amp;#39;s the guy right from the firm that&amp;#39;s his employee id he gave this to you no i stole it what listen you can spend all night trying to get to the guy or you could just go into his firm yourself and look come on let&amp;#39;s go yeah i can barely keep my eyes open myself they got me filing briefs sucks you actually came you must be harvey specter joe was it your friend fill you in on the deal that&amp;#39;s on the table let me just get it straight you caught him rifling through some files and in lieu of calling the police you want me to pay you off i never said that he did oh that&amp;#39;s great this way if i level a charge of extortion it&amp;#39;s hearsay huh ten years working for a law firm you learn a thing or two which is good &amp;#39;cause you sure as hell don&amp;#39;t make a lot of money doing it somehow i think you&amp;#39;re getting by fine just say i know the level you guys play at espionage happens all the time which is why i know you&amp;#39;ll do anything to protect your secrets well actually joe spina of clover lane in astoria queens i think we all would like those tax returns you filed jointly for the last six years while no longer living with your wife you know the irs can destroy you for that you think you&amp;#39;re the first person to try to extort me joe because that&amp;#39;s the level i play at now you&amp;#39;re a security guard who likes to take risks i like that so here&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re going to do this here is a generous donation to joey junior&amp;#39;s little league team now if it gets to them it gets to them if it doesn&amp;#39;t it doesn&amp;#39;t but the next time we talk it&amp;#39;s going to be me who wants a favor officer do i really need to pay you back let&amp;#39;s start with an explanation you said i needed to find evidence so i went to find some by breaking into another law firm is that really worse than paying off a security guard okay first of all i didn&amp;#39;t pay him off second of all if i hadn&amp;#39;t paid him off you&amp;#39;d be in jail right now you think i might be right about stan no i never said you were wrong i said we needed evidence what did you find something dreibach bought a shelf company months ago what&amp;#39;s a shelf company it&amp;#39;s a corporation that exists only on paper so its owners can hide their assets isn&amp;#39;t that a shell company no it&amp;#39;s a shelf company okay take a shell company give it a bank account credit history tax returns and let it season for years on a shelf someone buys it slots their name into it and they walk away with an established corporation with a pre existing history anyone looks any closer you shut it down and do it again that&amp;#39;s legal shelf companies are legal i&amp;#39;m guessing what tori&amp;#39;s doing with hers isn&amp;#39;t wait a minute is it called aberdeen yeah i saw it on the top of this list with other management companies all related to dreibach in that wrongful termination suit when we get back to the office i want you to find legal precedent that will allow us to subpoena those records okay on it but do i really have to pay you back every penny wait a minute how much was in that envelope hey what are you all doing in my desk dude you gotta check this out excuse me excuse me is that louis uh huh in the lobby is this a security camera a live feed what are you guys doing no this is from last night the guys in security emailed it up to louis this morning and why are we watching it on my computer well we&amp;#39;re not going to risk watching it on one of ours and everyone knows your password how does everybody know my password ross how hard is that to crack okay increases the odds okay shh here it comes oh what oh oh no what did he say to her evidently louis wants a restraining order and he needs this as evidence what uh um okay listen please don&amp;#39;t i came in here and it look i are you okay down louis if the message you left was another trick to get me down here no tricks i assure you come on in stan i&amp;#39;m jessica pearson oh yeah i know who you are you said if i accepted the severance agreement there wouldn&amp;#39;t be a lawsuit well there is one but not against you with you we know about aberdeen we know what tori was orchestrating and with your help we can expose her why should i help you what have you got to lose tell me what you need me to do hey what does he have you trying to find this time you really want to know uh i managed to get a look at some files involving our accounting firm what&amp;#39;s up with our accounting firm they&amp;#39;re stealing from us you know your phone bill you have all those surcharges you have no idea what they mean but you pay them anyway yeah yeah well dreibach&amp;#39;s doing the same thing to us except all their charges are a complete scam pretty sure the phone charges are a scam too yeah maybe so what do you need i need a legal reason to get those files without saying i saw those files you need them for court or you just need them why well you said you read them right yeah so then you already have them in here you&amp;#39;re right

oh that wasn&amp;#39;t a list for client referrals those were firms you should consider for representation we&amp;#39;re no longer your attorneys tori what we have no choice really it would be impossible to represent you when we plan on suing you for every penny you&amp;#39;ve got is this a joke aberdeen solutions created in june of sold to dreibach in dissolved two days ago before that it was bolton finances and before that it was norton services littleton llc where did you get those we know what you did tori you couldn&amp;#39;t have subpoenaed these files and yet we have them take a look they&amp;#39;re all there and now we have proof proof of what those are all legitimate corporations used for stealing money and lining your own pockets but don&amp;#39;t take my word for it guys hello tori yeah we hired stan to do a little independent consulting on our behalf and he&amp;#39;s come up with some very interesting connections it was easy even if i don&amp;#39;t really have a degree there was that vacation you invited me on last year to your new house in the bahamas a house you bought with money you stole from this firm my firm jessica jessica what you can&amp;#39;t use any of this we have attorney client privilege with dreibach accounting yes with the shelf companies no and unfortunately for you you&amp;#39;re listed on the shelf companies you stole from me you either come clean now or the only time you&amp;#39;ll see your children in the next decade will be during prison visiting hours so i&amp;#39;m going to get my job back now right i don&amp;#39;t see why not no stan you&amp;#39;re not what dreibach&amp;#39;s going bankrupt after this all shakes out even if they don&amp;#39;t they&amp;#39;re not going to hire you back why because you falsified your resume what am i supposed to do now well we just got you more than your severance package i suggest you use it to tide yourself over until you figure something out stan hey your best asset is your mind they can&amp;#39;t take that from you one little mistake you could go back to school become legitimate start over i never should have done it i told you they wouldn&amp;#39;t catch me what are

are freaking out that&#x27;s great harold i&#x27;m thinking about getting a tattoo you need a raise for that i&#x27;m really over paying for my apartment good morning everyone many of you seem to think this is about getting your raises early it isn&#x27;t suck we&#x27;ve discovered a breach at the firm a confidential witness list was leaked to a rival firm wakefield cady now it&#x27;s entirely possible that this was an honest mistake if so we urge the responsible party to come forward if not we&#x27;ll find out soon enough either way we will get to the bottom of this louis jessica seems to think a mistake has been made i don&#x27;t believe so i also don&#x27;t believe this is a matter of ethics it&#x27;s a matter of loyalty someone in this room has betrayed us all and it makes me sick and the fact that it went to those holier than thou pricks at wakefield cady you know what that makes me sicker now you all work together in the trenches shoulder to shoulder which means one of you must know who did this now if y&#x27;all harbor knowledge of the perpetrator and do not turn him in you are as bad as the perpetrator himself you along with the perpetrator will be fired he&#x27;s doing george w bush you&#x27;re either with us or against us folks he sounds like bush but he looks just like cheney you got something to tell me harold mmm mmm no not that dermatological problem that you were talking to me about earlier in my office no not that one no to show you how serious i am i have an incentive whoever turns this traitor in receives   you&#x27;re welcome feel free to go back to work   that&#x27;s a big tattoo yeah it would be huge why louis there was a witness list i don&#x27;t care tell me what you learned about travis tanner it&#x27;s all in there travis tanner went to yale undergrad and law honors in both he was a junior tennis champion tennis just like louis yeah he played in college too oh my god more importantly he was the youngest senior partner at clyde macphee this guy&#x27;s record is off the charts really he specializes in breaking class action lawsuits harris tobacco bell pesticide gravtech securities he broke them all how come i&#x27;ve never heard of him evidently he doesn&#x27;t like to take public credit stays off the radar he avoids the press i mean i only found this stuff by looking through court records now it makes sense what why he thinks i know him i know those other attorneys he thinks they&#x27;ve told me about him they never did no why not because he beat them this guy&#x27;s kind of a badass you want me to get you an autograph no i&#x27;m just respecting our foe foe it&#x27;s from the art of war no no look i need to know how those other cases are different from ours well those other cases were spread out geographically economically socially ours is in a single town a single school a single cluster of plaintiffs okay that&#x27;s good that tennis playing douche bag travis tanner is on the phone you know i listen travis what can i do for you yeah i&#x27;m happy to discuss the case on one condition you&#x27;re going to meet me at apple creek high school see you in an hour why do you want to meet there because that&#x27;s ground zero and i want the emotion of that school under my feet when i negotiate i thought you were against emotions i&#x27;m against having emotions i&#x27;m not against using them come on i thought we were homies jimmy i didn&#x27;t leak anything you know i remember you said you hated louis litt and you were second guessing your decision to become a lawyer i told you that in confidence over six cosmopolitans that doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re not the guy harold really you drink cosmopolitans stop doing that unless you&#x27;re with girls which you never are and jimmy are you kidding me going after harold what how do you know he didn&#x27;t do it how do we know you didn&#x27;t do it maybe you&#x27;re the guy oh my god guys this is ridiculous all right has it occurred to any of you that maybe this is all just a big test wow wow spoken like a person with something to hide louis was talking about loyalty maybe this is just some test to see how loyal we are by not turning on each other are you kidding jessica would never play along with something like that even if it&#x27;s not a test this is a law office not lord of the flies everybody get back to work are these the galusska briefs you guys louis has been hounding us for these why hasn&#x27;t anyone taken them to him are you serious wow you&#x27;re scared of him it&#x27;s louis litt it&#x27;s not darth vader this is what courage looks like jimmy pay attention please louis the galusska briefs sorry they&#x27;re late thank you mr mike ross you sure you&#x27;re ready for this i&#x27;m here aren&#x27;t i i&#x27;ve been looking into you you&#x27;re an elusive man yeah well when you&#x27;re number one you don&#x27;t need to broadcast your victories harvey that&#x27;s funny where i come from number one doesn&#x27;t usually challenge number two to a fight this school was apple creek&#x27;s pride parents felt safe sending their children here and teachers felt safe teaching here you know what apple creek high school is now a bunch of trailers on the outskirts of town all because years ago your clients failed to cap an oil well and gave them all cancer you see all these power lines around here they criss cross the entire town two miles down that road paint factory you&#x27;ve got a microwave tower and all this grass that you see it&#x27;s been treated with pesticide every week for twenty years you say it&#x27;s our fault i say you&#x27;re wrong that office mitch rosewall soccer coach brain cancer library monica dodd volunteered she ran it for years stomach cancer they both died last month and they sure as hell didn&#x27;t die from pesticide can you prove it if we go to trial it won&#x27;t be about proving anything it will be about monica mitch and kenny and you won&#x27;t stand a chance oh this is fun harvey i&#x27;m just sorry to say that we won&#x27;t get to do this in court against my advice emerson wants to settle you&#x27;re kidding me after all this you want to settle no i don&#x27;t but those are my instructions call it a draw mike get over to kenny&#x27;s house tanner&#x27;s going to try and make him cave hey i came as soon as i got the message kenny it&#x27;s harvey specter was travis tanner here i was just with him he couldn&#x27;t have beaten me by much sweetie why don&#x27;t you go inside okay baby okay no it wasn&#x27;t him it was someone else he wouldn&#x27;t tell me his name he said he was with pearson hardman so i let him in did he mention tanner&#x27;s name no but it was obvious that&#x27;s who he worked for he said me and the other plaintiffs would be getting a settlement offer soon what else he said if we don&#x27;t take it that they&#x27;re going to go after us that they have dirt on everyone he mentioned eva williams&#x27; arrest for public intoxication bernie rutherford&#x27;s shoplifting arrest when he was in college that&#x27;s criminal intimidation if they want to go after me that&#x27;s fine i can handle it but the others i don&#x27;t know if they can you have to stay strong kenny you cave everything falls apart one more thing what did this guy look like i don&#x27;t know he was average height brown hair brown eyes thanks you want me to start figuring out who this guy is no we&#x27;ll never find him how did you know tanner was going after kenny because if i was the type to go out of bounds that&#x27;s exactly what i&#x27;d do you&#x27;re not no huh so what&#x27;s our next move i&#x27;m calling in reinforcements what do you mean if tanner sent a guy to intimidate kenny he&#x27;s got something else up his sleeve and i want to know what it is oh man what nothing it&#x27;s you guys are like two sides of the same coin what are you saying he&#x27;s another me no one is another me you told donna i was another you i never said that you said you were looking for another you and then you hired me so see how that works logic mike let&#x27;s go in my office now oh damn mike tell me you didn&#x27;t leak the documents man are you our benedict arnold benedict arnold nice reference you helping your high school girlfriend with her homework again okay not cool mike you know darla&#x27;s

touching me right now you are what loyalty looks like you rooted out the person responsible for leaking the witness list to wakefield cady louis i have no idea what you&#x27;re talking about it was almost cute how you hid the evidence in the galusska briefs like you didn&#x27;t want to take the credit what louis i didn&#x27;t hide anything in don&#x27;t worry no one&#x27;s going to label you a snitch snitch we didn&#x27;t even think to check the fax machines that was brilliant the list was sent from right here in this firm this is a copy of a fax submission form sent from three days ago this doesn&#x27;t implicate anybody that&#x27;s the confidential employee code she must not have known that the machine recorded it she wait why am i being suspended i didn&#x27;t leak any documents who told louis i did this let&#x27;s go please this way miss get your arms no no no louis you have to stop this i didn&#x27;t turn rachel in oh that&#x27;s so sweet how you didn&#x27;t really mean to hand someone in wait mike stop you did a great thing and because of that great thing   and don&#x27;t spend it in one place you say thank you louis and then you&#x27;re welcome mike rachel i don&#x27;t want to talk to you hey come on you want come on why would you do that to me i didn&#x27;t do anything to you i didn&#x27;t fax that goddamn list and i didn&#x27;t turn you in then why was i just suspended mike all i know is that i gave louis a stack of briefs and there was some fax with your confidential code on it do you think that if i was going to leak firm documents i&#x27;d be dumb enough to fax them with my own code no i don&#x27;t but whoever did this must have framed you yeah well it worked rachel look you just they&#x27;re going to investigate this they&#x27;re going to clear your name you know that i have worked there for five years and this is how they treat me i&#x27;m suspended mike i&#x27;m probably going to be fired i should sue them okay let&#x27;s not do anything rash okay it&#x27;s not rash it&#x27;s standing up for myself rachel you&#x27;re over excuse me you wouldn&#x27;t happen to know what sort of wine pairs well with a duck l&#x27;orange would you mmm try something with a full fruit flavor like a cabernet sauvignon uh sauvignons are a little bit oaky for my palate this article right here is all about the resurgence of pinot noir you know you could just pay me right out in public but then i wouldn&#x27;t feel like james bond oh who does that make me pussy galore octopussy ah that&#x27;s enough harvey what do you have for me nothing on paper tanner&#x27;s clean he may break the rules but he covers his tracks you&#x27;ve never come up empty for me before i didn&#x27;t this time either tanner booked a conference room at the waldorf tomorrow at noon divide and conquer he&#x27;s going to gather my plaintiffs scare them and then give them a low ball offer and that&#x27;s illegal what you&#x27;ve used me for a lot of things you&#x27;ve never asked me to investigate another attorney before this guy&#x27;s good if he called your plaintiffs i can get his phone records and prove it he didn&#x27;t make those calls himself he&#x27;s not going to be at the waldorf either tomorrow but i will donna can you tell me about these confidential employee codes that louis says rachel used to fax the witness list over to wakefield cady i have a thousand things to do before lunch hold mike&#x27;s hand while he crosses the street not one of them donna this one&#x27;s for rachel what do you need i know we use the billing codes to charge the clients but what do we use the employee codes for they&#x27;re special codes for when you need to use the firm&#x27;s resources for personal reasons we can do that you can&#x27;t but rachel can why because a fifth year paralegal is more valuable to the firm than a first year associate okay so do you have a personal code i have two so where do you get them they&#x27;re generated by the it department we have an it department well the computers don&#x27;t run themselves at least until skynet goes active sarah connor no no that&#x27;s i&#x27;ll work on that really bad what uh hi excuse me i&#x27;m looking for benjamin you found him oh great i&#x27;m mike ross we just spoke on the phone man this place is like battlestar galactica where do you guys keep the cylons pearson hardman takes care of us because we&#x27;re on call twenty four seven if a server goes down or a partner&#x27;s computer crashes people die that&#x27;s a little dramatic don&#x27;t you think ben it&#x27;s benjamin i&#x27;m sure you don&#x27;t like it when people call you mike actually i prefer mike well mike six months ago i was at connolly white the network went haywire we were in a breach of contract litigation worth million they needed it fixed in an hour no one thought it could be done i had the network up and running again in minutes is that dramatic enough for you wow you&#x27;re like a regular zuckerberg zuckerberg zuckerberg couldn&#x27;t code his way out of a paper bag you called about the employee codes you&#x27;re a first year you can&#x27;t have one sorry okay well i don&#x27;t need one i just want to know if it&#x27;s possible for someone to gain access to somebody else&#x27;s code sure for one person me i have access to all of the codes okay so in your short tenure here has anyone ever asked you for access to someone else&#x27;s code once last week who i can&#x27;t tell you that why not it officer client privilege does that even exist ben it does in here all right ben why don&#x27;t we make a bet i think you mean a wager michael yeah sure i&#x27;m going to tell you every single number on this piece of paper and you&#x27;re going to give me that name and if you can&#x27;t then i&#x27;m going to give you this check for ten grand you get one number one comma one decimal point wrong and that money is mine oh and when i win i&#x27;ll also take one of those computers and for the record there&#x27;s not a single comma on there you ready rachel it&#x27;s mike i figured out who leaked the list to wakefield cady it was louis call me back hi i&#x27;m rachel zane i&#x27;m here for my job interview welcome to wakefield cady thank you okay as soon as we get inside i need you to find every plaintiff you interviewed and tell them they&#x27;re here under false pretenses done kenny&#x27;s meeting us here we need him to identify the man who came to see him and we&#x27;re going to wait for that guy to approach any of our plaintiffs and if we connect that guy to tanner then we have him on criminal intimidation and emerson petroleum will have no choice but to settle hey kenny good to see you this is going to be fun you were right he called every one of them you see the guy no start looking hey wait a minute mrs williams do you remember me i&#x27;m mike ross from the office i remember you do you mind if i ask you what you&#x27;re doing here today we were invited to come and hear a settlement offer really uh excuse me he came here himself well big mistake sorry to ruin your little brunch but i think you know damn well that you can&#x27;t legally address my clients hey i just came for the juice mmm pulp free i know i can&#x27;t talk to your clients directly but thank god you&#x27;re here harv because what i can do is i can talk to you harvey emerson petroleum is offering  to each and every one of your clients if they don&#x27;t take that this trial stretches out for years cross examinations will be brutal they take our settlement and this whole thing will be gone tomorrow now if any of your clients want to get in touch with me here&#x27;s my number mr ross harvey erase that number you&#x27;re not going to get away with what you&#x27;re doing you know that right what i just addressed you with a raised voice sometimes my ears aren&#x27;t so good if other people heard me i apologize harvey i&#x27;m just glad you were smart enough to figure out i booked the waldorf mmm i think i need to take this i&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s one of your clients wanting to take my settlement offer hello tanner i&#x27;m coming after you oh i got your number the plaintiffs are scared they&#x27;re talking about accepting tanner&#x27;s low ball offer those floodgates open and we&#x27;re done that&#x27;s why i went to go see clarkson the legal finance guys if we can get our plaintiffs a loan against a future jury award it will close the floodgates and buy us more time well those loans aren&#x27;t cheap harvey well it&#x27;s better than settling for pennies on the dollar then do it i tried but they won&#x27;t give us anything without collateral they don&#x27;t think you can win they&#x27;re wrong well that&#x27;s what i like to hear i need a million dollars to get that loan you&#x27;re talking about firm money yeah yeah no way that happens you don&#x27;t think i&#x27;m a good bet that has nothing to do with it this was your case and i gave it to you to win which i will do if you just show some faith in me you can have my faith but you&#x27;re not getting my money what are you doing here i left you three messages louis framed you we can take him down i don&#x27;t want to take him down mike why not because i want a fresh start so you don&#x27;t want to work at pearson hardman anymore i applied for a job at wakefield cady they offered it to me in the room i start monday you took a job at the company that ended up with the leaked list do you know what that looks like i don&#x27;t care what it looks like i&#x27;m not guilty and i need a job so the going gets rough and you just quit no i&#x27;m not quitting i was fired remember no you were suspended and you can still save your job well if louis wants me gone i&#x27;m gone rachel louis tried to frame me once and i fought back why aren&#x27;t you doing the same thing because except for you no one from pearson hardman has contacted me at all why would i fight to stay there they&#x27;re accusing me of spilling secrets i&#x27;ll show them spilling secrets i&#x27;ll tell wakefield cady everything i may not have a photographic memory mike but i sure as hell know a lot rachel moneypenny don&#x27;t call me that why not because she had a thing for him this is the other way around what you don&#x27;t like me i like you enough to give you this what&#x27;s that i tapped the phones at emerson petroleum this is a conference call between travis tanner and several high ranking emerson executives i hope they&#x27;re talking about more than just the weather they&#x27;re talking about tanner intimidating your client both you and i know that without a warrant this recording is not admissible in court it is if you testify that you don&#x27;t know where it came from why did you do this because you need it i&#x27;m not going to commit perjury to win a case oh weird look what i found oh you are a prince among men i don&#x27;t understand why you use skim milk and then put whip cream and sugar in it because i use skim milk i can put whip cream and sugar in it ah what&#x27;s wrong can we talk for a second yeah last week louis got rachel&#x27;s confidential code from the it department and and it&#x27;s a smoking gun he&#x27;s the one that set her up why would louis betray the firm uh i don&#x27;t know maybe he&#x27;s still upset that he got passed over for senior partner and leaked the list before he jumps ship mike louis is a lot of things but he&#x27;s not a traitor that man bleeds pearson hardman he&#x27;s probably wearing pearson hardman underwear right

a step ahead of me this entire time yeah it&#x27;s pretty obvious why why you told me that you knew he&#x27;d go to kenny because that&#x27;s what you&#x27;d do if you were willing to go out of bounds you anticipated him by thinking about what you&#x27;d do and and that&#x27;s exactly what he&#x27;s doing to you maybe the only way to get ahead of this guy is to i don&#x27;t know think about what you wouldn&#x27;t do surprise myself i like that you&#x27;re welcome you going to tell me what you&#x27;re doing nope that doesn&#x27;t seem fair to the person whose idea it was ah you&#x27;re gone

paralegal who got fired because of what you did i didn&#x27;t know it was her code i just needed some numbers man i didn&#x27;t think i was going to get caught look mike i made one mistake okay i mean haven&#x27;t you ever cut some corners done some things you regretted jimmy i like you man okay but to clear rachel&#x27;s name they have to know she wasn&#x27;t the one if you come forward maybe they fire you if i turn you in it&#x27;s going to follow you for the rest of your career it&#x27;s up to you harvey i&#x27;m going to do you a favor why don&#x27;t you tell mike ross to take a hike he can stay okay you see of your plaintiffs have already called me about the settlement it&#x27;s a matter of time before the rest of them see the light i win i don&#x27;t know the last time you checked but as of this morning all two hundred of my plaintiffs are staying with me bullshit i got them an advance against their settlement no finance company in their right mind will back your suit i don&#x27;t know if they taught you math at yale but that&#x27;s million  a plaintiff exactly what you tried to buy them off for you know what this means i&#x27;m going to hammer them all one by one break them down and it&#x27;s going to get ugly no you&#x27;re not what the hell is that it&#x27;s a conversation between you and emerson petroleum discussing how you sent a man to intimidate kenny verdasco take a listen don&#x27;t worry it&#x27;s not going to give you cancer no matter what that is it&#x27;s not admissible unless of course you had a warrant which you didn&#x27;t it showed up on my doorstep and i declared that on this affidavit which i&#x27;m about to send to court hmm so you&#x27;re going to perjure yourself just to win this case no i&#x27;m not going to perjure myself even if i were it

to take it and you and that shit eating grin are going to fly back to boston and never come back to my town again you can use mine i told you i&#x27;d get his autograph i can&#x27;t believe you you were going to perjure yourself just to win i thought you didn&#x27;t cross lines that&#x27;s the difference between guys like you and him i had no intention of submitting this affidavit i&#x27;m not going to perjure myself but tanner doesn&#x27;t know that and he never will how do you know because a man who&#x27;s willing to break the rules can&#x27;t imagine someone else wouldn&#x27;t you said that you took my advice and that you surprised yourself i did that loan i got for the plaintiffs i put up a million dollars of my own money to get it if that&#x27;s not having emotion i don&#x27;t know what is get out that seemed a little angry feeling good satisfied happy all right emotional okay maybe a little happy two million dollars didn&#x27;t i tell you he was my right hand i don&#x27;t

i&amp;#39;m really over paying for my apartment good morning everyone many of you seem to think this is about getting your raises early it isn&amp;#39;t suck we&amp;#39;ve discovered a breach at the firm a confidential witness list was leaked to a rival firm wakefield cady now it&amp;#39;s entirely possible that this was an honest mistake if so we urge the responsible party to come forward if not we&amp;#39;ll find out soon enough either way we will get to the bottom of this louis jessica seems to think a mistake has been made i don&amp;#39;t believe so i also don&amp;#39;t believe this is a matter of ethics it&amp;#39;s a matter of loyalty someone in this room has betrayed us all and it makes me sick and the fact that it went to those holier than thou pricks at wakefield cady you know what that makes me sicker now you all work together in the trenches shoulder to shoulder which means one of you must know who did this now if y&amp;#39;all harbor knowledge of the perpetrator and do not turn him in you are as bad as the perpetrator himself you along with the perpetrator will be fired he&amp;#39;s doing george w bush you&amp;#39;re either with us or against us folks he sounds like bush but he looks just like cheney you got something to tell me harold mmm mmm no not that dermatological problem that you were talking to me about earlier in my office no not that one no to show you how serious i am i have an incentive whoever turns this traitor in receives you&amp;#39;re welcome feel free to go back to work that&amp;#39;s a big tattoo yeah it would be huge why louis there was a witness list i don&amp;#39;t care tell me what you learned about travis tanner it&amp;#39;s all in there travis tanner went to yale undergrad and law honors in both he was a junior tennis champion tennis just like louis yeah he played in college too oh my god more importantly he was the youngest senior partner at clyde macphee this guy&amp;#39;s record is off the charts really he specializes in breaking class action lawsuits harris tobacco bell pesticide gravtech securities he broke them all how come i&amp;#39;ve never heard of him evidently he doesn&amp;#39;t like to take public credit stays off the radar he avoids the press i mean i only found this stuff by looking through court records now it makes sense what why he thinks i know him i know those other attorneys he thinks they&amp;#39;ve told me about him they never did no why not because he beat them this guy&amp;#39;s kind of a badass you want me to get you an autograph no i&amp;#39;m just respecting our foe foe it&amp;#39;s from the art of war no no look i need to know how those other cases are different from ours well those other cases were spread out geographically economically socially ours is in a single town a single school a single cluster of plaintiffs okay that&amp;#39;s good that tennis playing douche bag travis tanner is on the phone you know i listen travis what can i do for you yeah i&amp;#39;m happy to discuss the case on one condition you&amp;#39;re going to meet me at apple creek high school see you in an hour why do you want to meet there because that&amp;#39;s ground zero

any of you that maybe this is all just a big test wow wow spoken like a person with something to hide louis was talking about loyalty maybe this is just some test to see how loyal we are by not turning on each other are you kidding jessica would never play along with something like that even if it&amp;#39;s not a test this is a law office not lord of the flies everybody get back to work are

here and teachers felt safe teaching here you know what apple creek high school is now a bunch of trailers on the outskirts of town all because years ago your clients failed to cap an oil well and gave them all cancer you see all these power lines around here they criss cross the entire town two miles down that road paint factory you&amp;#39;ve got a microwave tower and all this grass that you see it&amp;#39;s been treated with pesticide every week for twenty years you say it&amp;#39;s our fault i say you&amp;#39;re wrong that office mitch rosewall soccer coach brain cancer library monica dodd volunteered she ran it for years stomach cancer they both died last month and they sure as hell didn&amp;#39;t die from pesticide can you prove it if we go to trial it won&amp;#39;t be about proving anything it will be about monica mitch and kenny and you won&amp;#39;t stand a chance oh this is fun harvey i&amp;#39;m just sorry to say that we won&amp;#39;t get to do this in court against my advice emerson wants to settle you&amp;#39;re kidding me after all this you want to settle no i don&amp;#39;t but those are my instructions call it a draw mike get over to kenny&amp;#39;s house

he mention tanner&amp;#39;s name no but it was obvious that&amp;#39;s who he worked for he said me and the other plaintiffs would be getting a settlement offer soon what else he said if we don&amp;#39;t take it that they&amp;#39;re going to go after us that they have dirt on everyone he mentioned eva williams&amp;#39; arrest for public intoxication bernie rutherford&amp;#39;s shoplifting arrest when he was in college that&amp;#39;s criminal intimidation if they want to go after me that&amp;#39;s fine i can handle it but the others i don&amp;#39;t know if they can you have to stay strong kenny you cave everything falls apart one more thing what did this guy look like i don&amp;#39;t know he was average height brown hair brown eyes thanks you want me to start figuring out who this guy is no we&amp;#39;ll never find him how did you know tanner was going after kenny because if i was the type to go out of bounds that&amp;#39;s exactly what i&amp;#39;d do you&amp;#39;re not no huh so what&amp;#39;s our next move i&amp;#39;m calling in reinforcements what do you mean if tanner sent a guy to intimidate kenny he&amp;#39;s got something else up his sleeve

one&amp;#39;s going to label you a snitch snitch we didn&amp;#39;t even think to check the fax machines that was brilliant the list was sent from right here in this firm this is a copy of a fax submission form sent from three days ago this doesn&amp;#39;t implicate anybody that&amp;#39;s the confidential employee code she must not have known that the machine recorded it she wait why am i being suspended i didn&amp;#39;t leak any documents who told louis i did this let&amp;#39;s go please this way miss get your arms no no no louis you have to stop this i didn&amp;#39;t turn rachel in oh that&amp;#39;s so sweet how you didn&amp;#39;t really mean to hand someone in wait mike stop you did a great thing and because of that great thing and don&amp;#39;t spend it in one place you say

didn&amp;#39;t fax that goddamn list and i didn&amp;#39;t turn you in then why was i just suspended mike all i know is that i gave louis a stack of briefs and there was some fax with your confidential code on it do you think that if i was going to leak firm documents i&amp;#39;d be dumb enough to fax them with my own code no i don&amp;#39;t but whoever did this must have framed you yeah well it worked rachel look you just they&amp;#39;re going to investigate this they&amp;#39;re going to clear your name you know that i have worked there for five years and this is how they treat me i&amp;#39;m suspended mike i&amp;#39;m probably going to be fired i should sue them okay let&amp;#39;s not do anything rash okay it&amp;#39;s not rash it&amp;#39;s standing up for myself rachel you&amp;#39;re over excuse me you wouldn&amp;#39;t happen to know what sort of wine pairs well with a duck l&amp;#39;orange would you mmm try something with a full fruit flavor like a cabernet sauvignon uh sauvignons are a little bit oaky for my palate this article right here is all about the resurgence of pinot noir you know you could just pay me right out in public but then i wouldn&amp;#39;t feel like james bond oh who does that make me pussy galore octopussy ah that&amp;#39;s enough harvey what do you have for me nothing on paper tanner&amp;#39;s clean he may break the rules but he covers his tracks you&amp;#39;ve never come up empty for me before i didn&amp;#39;t this time either tanner booked a conference room at the waldorf tomorrow at noon divide and conquer he&amp;#39;s going to gather my plaintiffs scare them and then give them a low ball offer and that&amp;#39;s illegal what you&amp;#39;ve used me for a lot of things you&amp;#39;ve never asked me to investigate another attorney before this guy&amp;#39;s good if he called your plaintiffs i can get his phone records and prove it he didn&amp;#39;t make those calls himself he&amp;#39;s not going to be at the waldorf either tomorrow but i will donna can you tell me about these confidential employee codes that louis says rachel used to fax the witness list over to wakefield cady i have a thousand things to do before lunch hold mike&amp;#39;s hand while he crosses the street not one of them donna this one&amp;#39;s for rachel what do you need i know we use the billing codes to charge the clients but what do we use the employee codes for they&amp;#39;re special codes for when you need to use the firm&amp;#39;s resources for personal reasons we can do that you can&amp;#39;t but rachel can why because a fifth year paralegal is more valuable to the firm than a first year associate okay so do you have a personal code i have two so where do you get them they&amp;#39;re generated by the

we&amp;#39;re going to wait for that guy to approach any of our plaintiffs and if we connect that guy to tanner then we have him on criminal intimidation and emerson petroleum will have no choice but to settle hey kenny good to see you this is going to be fun you were right he called every one of them you see the guy no start looking hey wait a minute mrs williams do you remember me i&amp;#39;m mike ross from the office i remember you do you mind if i ask you what you&amp;#39;re doing here today we were invited to come and hear a settlement offer really uh excuse me he came here himself well big mistake sorry to ruin your little brunch but i think you know damn well that you can&amp;#39;t legally address my clients hey i just came for the juice mmm pulp free i know i can&amp;#39;t talk to your clients directly but thank god you&amp;#39;re here harv because what i can do is i can talk to you harvey emerson petroleum is offering to each and every one of your clients if they don&amp;#39;t take that this trial stretches out for years cross examinations will be brutal they take our settlement and this whole thing will be gone tomorrow now if any of your clients want to get in touch with me here&amp;#39;s my number mr ross harvey erase that number you&amp;#39;re not going to get away with what you&amp;#39;re doing you know that right what i just addressed you with a raised voice sometimes my ears aren&amp;#39;t so good if other people heard me i apologize harvey i&amp;#39;m just glad you were smart enough to figure out i booked the waldorf mmm i think i need to take this i&amp;#39;m guessing it&amp;#39;s one of your clients wanting to take my settlement offer hello tanner i&amp;#39;m coming after you oh i got your number the plaintiffs are scared they&amp;#39;re talking about accepting tanner&amp;#39;s low ball offer those floodgates open and we&amp;#39;re done that&amp;#39;s why i went to go see clarkson the legal finance guys if we can get our plaintiffs a loan against a future jury award it will close the floodgates and buy us more time well those loans aren&amp;#39;t cheap harvey well it&amp;#39;s better than settling for pennies on the dollar then do it i tried but they won&amp;#39;t give us anything without collateral they don&amp;#39;t think you can win they&amp;#39;re wrong well that&amp;#39;s what i like to hear i need a million dollars to get that loan you&amp;#39;re talking about firm money yeah yeah no way that happens you don&amp;#39;t think i&amp;#39;m a good bet that has nothing to do with it this was your case and i gave it to you to win which i will do if you just show some faith in me you can have my faith but you&amp;#39;re not getting my money what are you doing here i left you three messages louis framed you we can take him down i don&amp;#39;t want to take him down mike why not because i want a fresh start so you don&amp;#39;t want to work at pearson hardman anymore i applied for a job at wakefield cady they offered it to me in the room i start monday you took a job at the company that ended up with the leaked list do you know what that looks like i don&amp;#39;t care what it looks like i&amp;#39;m not guilty and i need a job so the going gets rough and you just quit no i&amp;#39;m not quitting i was fired remember no you were suspended and you can still save your job well if louis wants me gone i&amp;#39;m gone rachel louis tried to frame me once and i fought back why aren&amp;#39;t you doing the same thing because except for you no one from pearson hardman has contacted me at all why would i fight to stay there they&amp;#39;re accusing me of spilling secrets i&amp;#39;ll show them spilling secrets i&amp;#39;ll tell wakefield cady everything i may not have a photographic memory mike but i sure as hell know a lot rachel moneypenny don&amp;#39;t call me that why not because she had a thing for him this is the other way around what you don&amp;#39;t like me i like you enough to give you this what&amp;#39;s that i tapped the phones at emerson petroleum this is a conference call between travis tanner and several high ranking emerson executives i hope they&amp;#39;re talking about more than just the weather they&amp;#39;re talking about tanner intimidating your client both you and i know that without a warrant this recording is not admissible in court it is if you testify that you don&amp;#39;t know where it came from why did you do this because you need it i&amp;#39;m not going to commit perjury to win a case oh weird look what i found oh you are a prince among men i don&amp;#39;t understand why you use skim milk and then put whip cream and sugar in it because i use skim milk i can put whip cream and sugar in it ah what&amp;#39;s wrong can we talk for a second yeah last week louis got rachel&amp;#39;s confidential code from the it department and and it&amp;#39;s a smoking gun he&amp;#39;s the one that set her up why would louis betray the firm uh i don&amp;#39;t know maybe he&amp;#39;s still upset that he got passed over for senior partner and leaked the list before he jumps ship mike louis is a lot of things but he&amp;#39;s not a traitor that man bleeds pearson hardman he&amp;#39;s probably wearing pearson hardman underwear right now mmm i went to the tennis club with him trust me he doesn&amp;#39;t wear underwear i care about rachel too louis didn&amp;#39;t do this okay and if you ever mention louis&amp;#39; underwear situation to me again you&amp;#39;re the one that brought it up go okay seventy four plaintiffs i can&amp;#39;t believe they&amp;#39;re willing to cave for slow down we need to figure out how to beat tanner guy&amp;#39;s been a step ahead of me this entire time yeah it&amp;#39;s pretty obvious why why you told me that you knew he&amp;#39;d go to kenny because that&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;d do if you were willing to go out of bounds you anticipated him by thinking about what you&amp;#39;d do and and that&amp;#39;s exactly what he&amp;#39;s doing to you maybe the only way to get ahead of this guy is to i don&amp;#39;t know think about what you wouldn&amp;#39;t do surprise myself i like that you&amp;#39;re welcome you going to tell me what you&amp;#39;re doing nope that doesn&amp;#39;t seem fair to the person whose idea it was ah you&amp;#39;re gone you wanted to talk talk i did i want to put this competition aside call it a draw you tapping out harv this isn&amp;#39;t about that this is about real people you make them a reasonable offer i&amp;#39;ll get them to take it real people you&amp;#39;re standing there in a suit asking me not to do my job you care so much about those real people i suggest you give them your lunch money but don&amp;#39;t ask me for mine vanessa i&amp;#39;m going to need that wiretap after all is there any more of that last cup did you make any no dude that&amp;#39;s common courtesy you finish a pot you make another one are you going to turn me in to louis if i don&amp;#39;t hmm get me fired too michael benjamin you got something for me a wager&amp;#39;s a wager fair is fair here&amp;#39;s your gx you&amp;#39;re a good man use it for porn and i&amp;#39;ll know weird hey louis how you doing why did benjamin just call you louis i don&amp;#39;t know he made a mistake oh no he didn&amp;#39;t he called you louis because he thinks you are louis what because you posed as louis to get rachel&amp;#39;s employee code didn&amp;#39;t you look mike it&amp;#39;s not what you think it&amp;#39;s exactly what i think come on start talking jimmy or i&amp;#39;ll go get benjamin and we can all go see jessica together listen wakefield cady offered me a junior partnership if i leaked the witness list no no listen mike i have huge law school debts okay i mean don&amp;#39;t you i can&amp;#39;t wait for pearson hardman to make me a partner so what are you still doing here then after i gave them the list they reneged on the offer big surprise yeah i didn&amp;#39;t see that one coming just don&amp;#39;t turn me in mike please i came from nothing i worked my ass off to get into harvard law and become an associate here you know who else worked their ass off rachel zane the paralegal who got fired because of what you did i didn&amp;#39;t know it was her code i just needed some numbers man i didn&amp;#39;t think i was going to get caught look mike i made one mistake okay i mean haven&amp;#39;t you ever cut some corners done some things you regretted jimmy i like you man okay but to clear rachel&amp;#39;s name they have to know she wasn&amp;#39;t the one if you come forward maybe they fire you if i turn you in it&amp;#39;s going to follow you for the rest of your career it&amp;#39;s up to you harvey i&amp;#39;m going to do you a favor why don&amp;#39;t you tell mike ross to take a hike he can stay okay you see of your plaintiffs have already called me about the settlement it&amp;#39;s a matter of time before the rest of them see the light i win i don&amp;#39;t know the last time you checked but as of this morning all two hundred of my plaintiffs are staying with me bullshit i got them an advance against their settlement no finance company in their right mind will back your suit i don&amp;#39;t know if they taught you math at yale but that&amp;#39;s million a plaintiff exactly what you tried to buy them off for you know what this means i&amp;#39;m going to hammer them all one by one break them down and it&amp;#39;s going to get ugly no you&amp;#39;re not what the hell is that it&amp;#39;s a conversation between you and emerson petroleum discussing how you sent a man to intimidate kenny verdasco take a listen don&amp;#39;t worry it&amp;#39;s not going to give you cancer no matter what that is it&amp;#39;s not admissible unless of course you had a warrant which you didn&amp;#39;t it showed up on my doorstep and i declared that on this affidavit which i&amp;#39;m about to send to court hmm so you&amp;#39;re going to perjure yourself just to win this case no i&amp;#39;m not going to perjure myself even if i were it wouldn&amp;#39;t be just to win this case it would be to get your ass thrown in jail see you have power of attorney and you&amp;#39;re going to accept this settlement million a plaintiff you&amp;#39;re going to take it and you and that shit eating grin are going to fly back to boston and never come back to my town again you can use mine i told you i&amp;#39;d get his autograph i can&amp;#39;t believe you you were going to perjure yourself just to win i thought you didn&amp;#39;t cross lines that&amp;#39;s the difference between guys like you and him i had no intention of submitting this affidavit i&amp;#39;m not going to perjure myself but tanner doesn&amp;#39;t know that and he never will how do you know because a man who&amp;#39;s willing to break the rules can&amp;#39;t imagine someone else wouldn&amp;#39;t you said that you took my advice and that you surprised yourself i did that loan i got for the plaintiffs i put up a million dollars of my own money to get it if that&amp;#39;s not having emotion i don&amp;#39;t know what is get out that seemed a little angry feeling good satisfied happy all right emotional okay maybe a little happy two million dollars didn&amp;#39;t i tell you he was my right hand i don&amp;#39;t know what to say you don&amp;#39;t say anything you tell me what it&amp;#39;s like when you deliver this news to everyone thank you i told you i&amp;#39;d win and it&amp;#39;s a good thing too because if you hadn&amp;#39;t oh what oh

labor oh i&#x27;ll get my hands dirty if i have to lucille but i believe charity begins at home yeah based on that rolex you wear i&#x27;d say that your favorite cause is doing pretty good we&#x27;re going to need your signature here whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa interest they&#x27;re worried about stable shelters&#x27; solvency they&#x27;re worried they should try being executive director if you don&#x27;t recover the money that anthony mazlo embezzled from us every one of these projects goes dark unless you&#x27;ve got a spare room or two for a couple thousand families in your condo i&#x27;m not really a roommate kind of guy oh harvey&#x27;s deposing elliot perkins mazlo&#x27;s number two this afternoon perkins had to have knowledge of this and he&#x27;s going to give up his boss that&#x27;s a promise excuse me check it out mazlo spent a night on doggie day care on his trip to greece greece what nothing tell me my first time was in greece oh my god you&#x27;re picturing that right now aren&#x27;t you i have no choice i&#x27;m a visual person you two are really adorable we&#x27;re hours from trial and you&#x27;re gossiping like two year olds in sleep away camp listen up lucille jackson is not just the head of stable shelters okay she also sits on the board of directors of several of our largest clients so if we lose this case i doubt that her generosity is going to extend to us i would in my office bring the clarity drilling ipo jerome jensen is here come on whoa whoa whoa lucille&#x27;s case is all hands on deck harvey you can&#x27;t just i can and i am i thought we were working on this together yeah we are louis the same way a golfer and his caddie work together be that as it may we are deposing elliot perkins in fifteen minutes so perkins can wait just make sure that my iron is nice and shiny when i get there okay come on mike harvey jerome jensen meet mike ross he&#x27;s got the latest on the ipo hello mike mr jensen i&#x27;m not here to talk about my business harvey looks like my daughter might be getting into some trouble mildred wisnewski what&#x27;s lola doing with a fake id well that&#x27;s what i hope you can find out it slipped out of her purse when she was ordering a drink at a friend&#x27;s bar mitzvah any idea what it&#x27;s about my relationship with lola has been rocky for a few years if i asked her she&#x27;d just lie the truth is i don&#x27;t need to know i just need you to take care of it thank you what the hell is harvey doing he&#x27;s supposed to be deposing elliot perkins he&#x27;s with a client i don&#x27;t care we have a deposition don&#x27;t even try it louis i&#x27;m sorry let&#x27;s just start over okay hi donna hi you know i like you right but in the firm&#x27;s food chain i am a humpback whale and you are phytoplankton june rd  that date means nothing to me doesn&#x27;t it who told you is the important thing how i know or that i know does harvey know he can i am going to pay you i just don&#x27;t have cash on me right now so i&#x27;m going to just tell norma to run her old ass out to the atm and bring it back in a jiff hmm all right i don&#x27;t want your money louis i just want you to i was not here i was not here i was not here all right let&#x27;s get started shall we isn&#x27;t harvey specter leading this deposition he sent me now mr perkins my first question to you is do you sleep well at night of course you do because you have a roof and a bed and running water and by contrast thousands of families are going to be sleeping on the street when stable shelters is forced to suspend their operations all because of the money that you stole i never stole anything you&#x27;re mazlo&#x27;s number two the money was embezzled do you deny that absolutely please robert i know as general counsel you just basically push paper but will you please warn mr perkins of the penalties of perjury look i&#x27;m not aware of any perjury we know about your account in the caymans twenty million dollars are you are you kidding me that transaction was legitimate oh when i take this public you&#x27;re going to be disgraced your wife your children your whole family disgraced would you show my client some respect and and that transaction had nothing to do with the firm bullshit you either took your cut from mazlo or it was hush money either way you&#x27;re going to live the rest of your life as a pariah or you give up mazlo now is this a deposition or an inquisition this is ridiculous i can show you the records oh sure you can because you&#x27;re the guy who invented losses in mortgage backed securities when you never even bought them i had no part in that but you were aware of it and you did nothing about it come on louis could i could i get a glass of water please you can&#x27;t get any water we don&#x27;t have any you give up mazlo now and this all stops all right look my client needs a break we can continue this in ten minutes i&#x27;m just getting started i don&#x27;t get it she looks so sweet don&#x27;t let the photo fool you she&#x27;s less girl next door more girl with the dragon tattoo hmm look my plate is full with stable shelters i need you to look into jerome&#x27;s daughter why didn&#x27;t he just hire a private investigator because if there&#x27;s a problem an investigator can&#x27;t fix it i&#x27;m not just a lawyer to jerome okay i&#x27;m i&#x27;m more like robert duvall in the godfather his consigliere okay what uh nothing just if you&#x27;re his robert duvall you&#x27;re coming to me so technically i&#x27;m your robert duvall you&#x27;re my fredo fredo no clear the hall please robert what the hell happened to perkins ask that pit bull of yours oh no actually i prefer a female masseuse is that can i call you right back right back okay bye perkins just got wheeled out on a stretcher well he couldn&#x27;t handle the heat he&#x27;s probably faking it what were you thinking starting that deposition without me i don&#x27;t know maybe if you were doing your job oh no what it&#x27;s from geller perkins wasn&#x27;t faking anything our best chance to nail anthony mazlo is dead see the money wanna stay for your meal get another piece of pie for your wife everybody wanna know how it feel everybody wanna see what it&#x27;s like i&#x27;ll even eat a bean pie i don&#x27;t mind me and missy is so early busy busy making money all right all step back i&#x27;m &#x27;bout to dance the greenback boogie well he blew off the deposition so i was just picking up the slack i was letting perkins sweat it was a tactic which you completely undermined well i believe i made him sweat and then some are you actually proud of what you did as far as i&#x27;m concerned whatever happened to that guy was a result of his own guilt and i will not apologize for deposing a criminal in a vigorous manner losing perkins is a complication we&#x27;re just going to have to work harder to unearth mazlo&#x27;s money trail as for what happened i&#x27;ve spoken to the hospital and the cause of death was a pulmonary embolism it was nothing you did would it be okay if i took the credit louis i need to have a word with harvey okay financial crime is that man&#x27;s forte yes he over stepped his rank but i&#x27;m not about to throw the baby out with the bathwater louis is the bathwater believe it or not harvey you can be a real pain in the ass to work with too oh i get along with me just fine yes well i&#x27;m not about to tell lucille jackson that we didn&#x27;t win because we couldn&#x27;t work together you need to figure out how to collaborate with louis so the name on lola jensen&#x27;s fake id wasn&#x27;t just pulled from thin air it belongs to an assistant controller at clarity drilling and you&#x27;re telling me this why you wanted me to look into it i didn&#x27;t ask you to explain the problem to me i asked you to fix it for me hey did louis really kill a guy is that what the associate rumor mill has been churning out actually i think he started it yeah he also claims to be &#x27; with a full head of hair louis with hair that&#x27;s good how did you get past donna you waited until she peed didn&#x27;t you i mean the woman retains water like a camel i see that the greatest band of all time is conspicuously absent and who would that be louis oh i don&#x27;t know a little british band called queen should have seen that coming you know real musicians they don&#x27;t wear eyeliner oh really why don&#x27;t you tell that to the artist formerly known as prince who is once again named prince what do you want louis well i think now that we&#x27;re working together we should set some ground rules first rule never touch my records or anything else in this office fine that includes the furniture i&#x27;m trying to build a rapport with you okay i mean i think our relationship needs a little work let&#x27;s hold off the couples counseling until our fifth anniversary don&#x27;t you think look mazlo&#x27;s lawyer moved to push up the trial they know we need time to cultivate another witness well i say we bluff i mean perkins implicated mazlo the minute his lawyer walked out of the room it&#x27;s hearsay louis not if it&#x27;s a deathbed confession maybe while geller was making the call i had a little conversation with perkins so you want to lie about what perkins said and how he said it well what&#x27;s your brilliant solution harvey i&#x27;m having the money in perkins&#x27; account traced as we speak and i have another witness in mind i get anthony mazlo across that table you know i&#x27;ll break him the way you broke perkins yeah if need be you&#x27;re not hearing me we need to hold off on any meeting i just want to know why that&#x27;s that&#x27;s final louis question why would someone named lola jensen ever want to be known as mildred wisnewski who are you my name is mike ross i&#x27;m a lawyer let me guess pearson hardman you know forging a government document like this after is next to impossible god there must have been a glitch at the dmv why did you come here your father came to us because he&#x27;s worried about you if he was that worried he&#x27;d be here himself he wouldn&#x27;t have sent an empty suit you don&#x27;t know anything about me i on the other hand know that you used this id to funnel payments from clarity drilling to some fake company that you set up locksley llc you&#x27;re stealing money from your father&#x27;s company a couple million so far i don&#x27;t need to know why but i do need you to return it now actually you do need to know why this is groundwater from clarity&#x27;s fracking operation south of tulsa it&#x27;s got elevated levels of dibutoxyethanol methane and benzene this compares samples taken pre drilling to levels taken last week how did you get that that&#x27;s classified company data i&#x27;m good with computers wait a minute locksley llc as in robin of locksley as in robin hood these toxins are known to cause kidney failure liver cancer and infertility the epa fines were a slap on the wrist but the settlement that your firm negotiated with the victims it doesn&#x27;t matter how pure your motives are you&#x27;re committing a very serious crime threaten all you want okay there is no way that my father is going to let this go public right before his ipo i&#x27;m not giving the money back i&#x27;m giving it away in terms of living relatives i didn&#x27;t find anything but when i looked into the estates of relatives who&#x27;d passed away the holding was originally in the name of the aunt your theory on perkins was right harvey what are you doing rachel&#x27;s services are under my purview i&#x27;m sorry i&#x27;m going to change that anthony mazlo and his attorney are in the conference room at whose invitation oh what you think i called them you i i didn&#x27;t then mazlo feels he has an advantage and he&#x27;s pressing it hey fellows thanks for meeting us on such short notice i figured you&#x27;d be on a flight right now mr mazlo somewhere with no extradition agreement let&#x27;s get to the point without perkins you don&#x27;t have a case this report summarizes an internal investigation we conducted what inez has just handed you is hard evidence of fraudulent investments and fake losses perpetrated by perkins you guys have a real penchant for fiction don&#x27;t you no he duped all of us as ceo he betrayed me just as much as the investors we found an offshore account worth million just hold on a second lucille jackson trusted you to manage million endowment if perkins takes  where the hell is the rest of it in light of these findings we&#x27;d like to offer a settlement yeah fifteen million ten cents on the dollar that&#x27;s a slap in the face well we advise all our clients that investments carry risk you want a risk free return buy treasury bills or i don&#x27;t know hide your money under the mattress while you were writing the great american novel i&#x27;ve been checking facts the million that perkins had overseas was legitimate he was innocent the money your firm embezzled is still out there and this so called investigation it isn&#x27;t worth the paper it&#x27;s printed on well lucille jackson may beg to differ counselor a bridge loan means she&#x27;s desperate our offer is non negotiable i won&#x27;t accept this offer today or a year from now now since you&#x27;ve all invited yourselves over feel free to see yourselves out so first you attack me for wanting to lie about perkins and then you turn around and do the same exact thing i wasn&#x27;t lying what are you saying to me harvey what the hell are you saying to me that perkins had no involvement whatsoever that&#x27;s exactly what i&#x27;m saying louis he was innocent huh it&#x27;s no surprise that mazlo low balled us i&#x27;m just passing along this offer as a formality fifteen million dollars is not insignificant but now is not the time to settle we have to strengthen our hand all right here&#x27;s my problem best case scenario we go to trial the jury awards us a settlement obviously mazlo appeals that it&#x27;s three years before i see any money and my foundation is long gone by that point no i&#x27;m not going to let mazlo pocket the lion&#x27;s share of your endowment i&#x27;m not interested in a pyrrhic victory neither are we and to prove it we&#x27;re going to forego our usual fee and return to you the money you&#x27;ve already paid i grew up sleeping in my mama&#x27;s car and in and out of more halfway houses than i can count and one thing i realized is that every penny matters so thank you what you going to do perkins may have been innocent but he was still mazlo&#x27;s direct report i&#x27;m going to find out what he knew thank you your job is to verify every detail of mazlo&#x27;s internal investigation it is not about the crime now it&#x27;s about the cover up this says perkins acted alone well he&#x27;s the perfect scapegoat he can&#x27;t defend himself you want to go to the bathroom you don&#x27;t bother coming back by the way that goes for personal phone calls emails and texts i detect a whiff of slacking you are done get it you find anything i&#x27;ll be in my office louis i&#x27;m still working on harvey&#x27;s case jerome jensen can go screw himself for all i care but harvey explicitly told me i don&#x27;t care if a burning bush told you mike the only commandments you need to focus on right now come from me there is something wrong with louis that&#x27;s not my problem i answer to harvey sitting home alone with your kids and no job harvey you solve jerome&#x27;s problem yet uh about to but i need your corporate card first what for well i thought you didn&#x27;t want me to explain it to you you&#x27;re right i don&#x27;t okay it&#x27;s killing you not knowing what i&#x27;m going to use this for isn&#x27;t it nope please let me tell you if you bring that back to me and it smells like stripper you&#x27;re fired i don&#x27;t i don&#x27;t go to places like that you had to send someone you couldn&#x27;t just call me if you wanted this to be private you should have just robbed me you robbed the company i had to involve other people okay why don&#x27;t we take a seat i think that we could probably why are you here i want to tell you my side of things okay i&#x27;m not proud of the fact that we contaminated people&#x27;s water but we apologized we implemented safeguards we negotiated a payout that was more than generous if that&#x27;s what you think then you are lying to yourself i think that we could keep this civil no she&#x27;s right it&#x27;s true i am lying to myself i thought this was a phase that uh it was hormones that it would pass but the truth is i raised a thief okay i think we&#x27;re going to need a minute thank you a thief my research is making the planet more habitable okay you are making money destroying it you have no respect for me that&#x27;s fine but at least respect the workers you&#x27;re stealing from them too you think i&#x27;m such a criminal arrest me so i organized this so that you two could clear the air but it seems we&#x27;ve gotten off on the wrong foot you know what it&#x27;s the same story as always dad you duck your responsibilities lola lola what if i paid the company back with my own money i don&#x27;t think that would be a very good idea it would make you a conspirator i&#x27;m not turning my daughter in to the police this is not about the company image well the good news is she hasn&#x27;t distributed the money yet the money is irrelevant i came to pearson hardman to take care of this instead my daughter and i are further apart than ever i can&#x27;t imagine how hard it is right now people are saying the most horrible things about elliot they must think i&#x27;ve gone deaf anthony mazlo has been dragging your husband&#x27;s name through the mud to make him a scapegoat mrs perkins i&#x27;m here to help i don&#x27;t understand you work for the other side i work for a charitable organization that had all its money stolen i&#x27;m on the other side of anthony mazlo not your husband and i don&#x27;t want to see his memory painted with the same brush what would i have to do this isn&#x27;t the time or the place no it&#x27;s okay what would i have to do i&#x27;d like to know everything elliot has ever told you about mazlo any details would help mrs perkins uh i&#x27;m louis litt and i just want to let you know that i&#x27;m going to do whatever it takes to clear your husband&#x27;s name his name my husband would be alive today if it weren&#x27;t for you we don&#x27;t know that i know what happened in that room well at the time we didn&#x27;t have all the facts but now we do i can&#x27;t believe that you have the audacity to come here i don&#x27;t ever want to see your face again and you can forget about me helping you what the hell are you doing i was deposing the widow just like you i came here to pay my respects and initiate a relationship not aggravate a grieving woman i brought flowers you just cost us a potential witness oh really well maybe maybe if you&#x27;d shared your game plan with me oh the same way that you shared your game plan with me how do you expect her to react to seeing you you need to get your shit together and find us a new witness lola i wanted to apologize for earlier today can i come in uh yeah of course nice gesture the botanical gardens oh yeah he said it was a pretty special place for you guys it was and then he became ceo but i&#x27;m not here to reminisce i must say i was really impressed you figured out what i was doing especially since you&#x27;re not even a real lawyer what are you what are you talking about i accessed harvard law school&#x27;s alumni directory every class that graduated for the last ten years no record of mike ross at all yeah the dean&#x27;s office was supposed to fix that they they put my name wrong in the system i checked your social security number against the database how did you get my social security number easily here&#x27;s the deal leave me alone or i expose you you don&#x27;t really seem that worried about this threats like hers are a tactic they&#x27;re effective because they distract you from what you&#x27;re supposed to be doing are you crazy what we should be doing is backing the hell off and how would that go huh jerome you came to us with a problem we discovered that your daughter stole million from your company and our conclusion is you&#x27;re shit out of luck  i don&#x27;t really care how it would go all i care about is my life and keeping our secret i told you it&#x27;s a distraction she won&#x27;t pull that trigger why do you think she hasn&#x27;t distributed that money yet why do you think jerome doesn&#x27;t want us to go to the police i don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s because they both want to bury the hatchet and if any of that stuff happens they can&#x27;t then what figure out a way to make him reconcile it&#x27;s easy yeah it&#x27;s easy inez right louis litt i know who you are so is this what you do for mazlo you clean up his dirty laundry leave me alone you know you have your whole career ahead of you when mazlo goes down and you&#x27;re part of this cover up no one is going to hire you i can&#x27;t help you listen can i just tell you something inez in my experience people respond to two things okay and that&#x27;s the carrot and the stick now i prefer the stick and if you do not help me i will devote my considerable expertise to sticking it to you the same way you stuck it to perkins inez stop let&#x27;s go with the carrot inez harvey specter i appreciate you coming forward i should have done this sooner what changed i can&#x27;t be a part of a company like that anymore are you ready to testify against anthony mazlo in open court i am i assume you&#x27;ve documented his malfeasance because otherwise it&#x27;s he said she said  the entire paper trail from the beginning all the way to last week harvey asked me to fix this problem with lola but i can&#x27;t because your daughter&#x27;s not the problem mr jensen you are are you trying to get fired no i&#x27;m not i&#x27;m your attorney it&#x27;s my job to give you advice but you&#x27;re her father it&#x27;s your job to raise her now you can go to another firm but there&#x27;s not a lawyer in the city that can do that job for you please don&#x27;t lecture me on parenting mr jensen i had a difficult relationship with my father so trust me when i tell you that lola wants to forgive you but she needs you to take the first step well we tried it your way we went to lunch and you saw how well that worked out my daughter is not a child she&#x27;s an adult she made these choices as an adult if you just found a way to you&#x27;re my lawyer this is a legal problem my daughter brought this on herself now i desperately do not want her to go to prison but if she doesn&#x27;t return the money she will thank you where&#x27;s mazlo he was afraid to face us himself what do you want we know about your entire scheme what scheme oh the scheme where mazlo is laundering money through dubai how do you know about dubai we cultivated another source what kind of settlement are you looking for one that includes punitive damages send inez in here please i don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find her at her desk why not because she agreed to testify for us i doubt that when your colleague approached her she came straight to us he even tried to bribe me he said if i ratted out mr mazlo he&#x27;d get me a job as an assistant to jessica pearson everything she told you was a complete fabrication there is no dubai i seem to recall you mentioning something about penalties for perjury at our last meeting well the penalty for bribing a witness is just as severe and we&#x27;re willing to overlook that indiscretion if you convince your client to take our settlement offer well our revised settlement offer revised yes exactly half of what it was before what the hell were you thinking we needed a new witness you didn&#x27;t think to look into her story i don&#x27;t know did you look into it you were the one who brought her in i assumed you had like any halfway decent lawyer would we were under the gun and i was under strict instructions from my golf pro to get another witness no i told you to get another witness not bribe one that&#x27;s enough as for the threat against louis no money changed hands i&#x27;m not concerned with louis he brought your name into it okay the offer was to be your assistant now you&#x27;re exposed because of what he did is that true she is an executive assistant to the head of a major investment firm she&#x27;s not going to work for a junior partner so you tried to bribe her no it wasn&#x27;t a bribe jessica it was an incentive i thought she&#x27;d be more likely to talk if she wasn&#x27;t worried about being fired i want you to go to mazlo and take their offer i&#x27;m not ready to do that i&#x27;m not either i waived lucille&#x27;s fee because a certain senior partner said we&#x27;d never go to trial i said that before you stuck me with louis not the point she can&#x27;t afford it and neither can we give me time give it to me without louis and we&#x27;ll see who can afford it and who can&#x27;t you have until the end of the day you come up empty i&#x27;m taking the offer to lucille myself jessica i went to perkins&#x27; widow not another word you try something like that again and it will be your last day at this firm you said jerome wouldn&#x27;t pull the trigger you were wrong he&#x27;s ready i don&#x27;t have time for that right now harvey when the police show up at lola&#x27;s doorstep we&#x27;re done has she distributed the money yet no she hasn&#x27;t but she&#x27;s about she hasn&#x27;t and she won&#x27;t because what she wants is her daddy&#x27;s attention now sit down with me and let&#x27;s deal with this yeah yeah sure why don&#x27;t you tell me what you need mazlo was in liechtenstein the day that lucille&#x27;s endowment evaporated yeah maybe he was skiing nobody goes to liechtenstein for pleasure why don&#x27;t we subpoena the bank records how many banks can there be that place is like switzerland on steroids we&#x27;ll never see those records so what the hell do you want from me then what did you just say to me i once suggested that we hack harvard&#x27;s records to cover my ass and you laughed at me and now it turns out that you were wrong and it&#x27;s about to cost me my career where are you going you told me to fix my case why don&#x27;t you fix yours i hope you came here to tell me harvey&#x27;s backing off i wish i could but he&#x27;s not that&#x27;s too bad you had such a promising career god lola you act like you care about a higher cause but of all the companies that exist you chose your dad&#x27;s a company that&#x27;s trying to make amends for what it did i really don&#x27;t need to hear another speech from a wannabe suit god you think i&#x27;m your enemy huh well i&#x27;m not i didn&#x27;t even come here to talk to you about me or your father new york iowa kansas forty states that all have housing projects that will vanish if we don&#x27;t find out information that only you can help us get so you can steal money from your father&#x27;s company or you can blow the whistle on me if you want to but if you really care about people the way that you claim to you&#x27;re going to do this first are we close i&#x27;m accessing the banks through a server in china unless you&#x27;d rather me use yours take your time done all right there are banks in liechtenstein this is every account in every single one of them none of the accounts is listed under anthony mazlo forget about the name find an account with million embezzled from stable shelters on that date harvey it&#x27;s time unless you have something i&#x27;m calling lucille to settle jessica you know how liechtenstein doesn&#x27;t respond to subpoenas so i responded for them just trust me we&#x27;ve got everything we need to find lucille&#x27;s money it&#x27;s not here sounds like you need more than just another minute you need another person someone whose expertise is financial crime no no harvey bring in louis or i&#x27;m calling lucille donna i need to talk to louis he&#x27;s not in his office huh norma wouldn&#x27;t tell you where he is well she didn&#x27;t um you didn&#x27;t ask her did you that woman she gives me the creeps oh you&#x27;re such a wuss what did you just say to me i think we both know what i just said norma where is he what you&#x27;re kidding what shh i come here when i need to be alone  magnum really you feeling lucky today punk you know i understand that me pissing the bed on this case must be really really fun for you no louis it&#x27;s not the one thing you and i have in common is we need to win i noticed that and i came here because even after everything we can win no i can watch while you win louis i&#x27;m not here to give you shit listen i respect you i bribed a witness you incentivized her i went to see perkins&#x27; widow to apologize i killed a man that you thought had it coming i don&#x27;t think you heard what i said i respect you you need my help i wouldn&#x27;t phrase it exactly like that well if you need my help you better phrase it exactly like that okay you want me to say it i&#x27;ll say it i&#x27;m under the gun and i need your help i&#x27;ve got the information but you&#x27;ve got the financial expertise to break this case now let&#x27;s put the gun down and go get him okay first just stand over there for a second don&#x27;t push it so what was the exact amount of money that was lost from stable shelters&#x27; account why    i&#x27;m good with numbers huh all right what do you have we&#x27;ve compiled a printout of every account that had a deposit made on the day in question in all of liechtenstein&#x27;s banks okay well we are going to focus on excuse me these five banks how can you be sure watch this these four banks have a history of capitulating to subpoenas so mazlo would know these six have us corporate parents which would expose their accounts to federal scrutiny once again mazlo would know and then the one that he&#x27;s got right there is low in reserves therefore its solvency is in question and there is no way in hell that mazlo would take his stolen money and put it into some shaky bank so we can be sure every person who embezzles money they do it in their own way but the one thing that they all have in common is that they never put all their eggs in one basket so we are going to be looking at a combination of accounts across banks well i mean maybe across banks maybe the same bank but we&#x27;re definitely looking at more than one account ooh how do we figure out which accounts are his because they&#x27;re all going to add up to the same exact amount of money that was lost from stable shelters&#x27; account well how do you know when the account was drained it had to go somewhere what goes out from lucille&#x27;s had to go into mazlo&#x27;s simple law of mathematics so we just have to figure out a combination of accounts that adds up to     i&#x27;m good with numbers too thanks for meeting us on such short notice i assume you&#x27;re ready to take our offer i rushed right down well we just have a few questions before we get to any of that we didn&#x27;t agree to answer any questions no no robert it&#x27;s okay i&#x27;m happy to play have you ever been to liechtenstein mr mazlo you know i&#x27;ve been to many places among them liechtenstein really well of those many places did you open seven different bank accounts the amounts of which add up to exactly the same amount of money that disappeared from lucille jackson&#x27;s endowment fund i doubt it what i don&#x27;t doubt is that if you trace the money that went into those accounts you&#x27;ll find that it came from our corporate offices in sri lanka it&#x27;s completely legitimate i mean i&#x27;m happy to show you the records whenever you&#x27;d like oh that&#x27;s great isn&#x27;t that great well after that can you show us the records of the seven safety deposit boxes that you opened at those same banks the same day i don&#x27;t have to answer that this isn&#x27;t a deposition you&#x27;re so right it&#x27;s more of a presentation we can make it a deposition or a trial up to you we have pictures of you entering those banks and we have enough to crack their subpoenas it&#x27;s just a matter of time tony all right what do you want what do i want well it&#x27;s not about me it&#x27;s about lucille she wants your head on a stick but she&#x27;ll settle for her money back and your resignation we agree right here no criminal prosecution done if lucille doesn&#x27;t get her money back today nothing&#x27;s done great that&#x27;s perfect you are back in business the wire transfer just went through girl you came through that is what we do harvey harvey get in here lucille wants to thank you in person i&#x27;ve always got time for gratitude harvey you didn&#x27;t let me settle and i appreciate your tenacity the truth is i didn&#x27;t do this on my own have you met louis litt you guys are doing such good work i just want you to know it dean waiser have i told you how valuable you are to this company because you&#x27;re not just kidding janice i want you to take the rest of the day off because you&#x27;re so good and i really mean it harold  tequila shots you and me sharp be there louis luis what&#x27;s up what were you just doing in there what i was just let me guess you were cutting me out what are you talking about the little impromptu meeting you just had with jessica and lucille that you conveniently left me out of i didn&#x27;t leave you out of anything man i thought we were a team i thought this was the start of something but i louis now i see the truth all too clearly louis i was walking by and they called me in yeah just in time to take the credit for what i did i didn&#x27;t do that i wouldn&#x27;t even think of doing that but you know what you would and that&#x27;s your problem right there i got your email about mazlo not a bad way for locksley llc to go out looks like the firm owes you one i think you owe me one whoa uh is this the real thing yeah i told the dean&#x27;s office you&#x27;d lost yours they were happy to oblige for one of their top graduates i don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re awesome or terrifying also i added a layer of protection for you uh the harvard law school alumni database it&#x27;s all there your name class rank social security number you do realize you&#x27;ve just made me party to a crime right you can always call them up report it as a glitch let me guess untraceable i&#x27;m not saying you won&#x27;t get

charity begins at home yeah based on that rolex you wear i&amp;#39;d say that your favorite cause is doing pretty good we&amp;#39;re going to need your signature here whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa interest they&amp;#39;re worried about stable shelters&amp;#39; solvency they&amp;#39;re worried they should try being executive director if you don&amp;#39;t recover the money that anthony mazlo embezzled from us every one of these projects goes dark unless you&amp;#39;ve got a spare room or two for a couple thousand families in your condo i&amp;#39;m not really a roommate kind of guy oh harvey&amp;#39;s deposing elliot perkins mazlo&amp;#39;s number two this afternoon perkins had to have knowledge of this and he&amp;#39;s going to give up his boss that&amp;#39;s a promise excuse me

have no choice i&amp;#39;m a visual person you two are really adorable we&amp;#39;re hours from trial and you&amp;#39;re gossiping like two year olds in sleep away camp listen up lucille jackson is not just the head of stable shelters okay she also sits on the board of directors of several of our largest clients so if we lose this case i doubt that her generosity is going to extend to us i would in my office bring the clarity drilling ipo jerome jensen is here come on whoa whoa whoa lucille&amp;#39;s case is all hands on deck harvey you can&amp;#39;t just i can and i am i thought we were

business harvey looks like my daughter might be getting into some trouble mildred wisnewski what&amp;#39;s lola doing with a fake id well that&amp;#39;s what i hope you can find out it slipped out of her purse when she was ordering a drink at a friend&amp;#39;s bar mitzvah any idea what it&amp;#39;s about my relationship with lola has been rocky for a few years if i asked her she&amp;#39;d just lie the truth is i don&amp;#39;t need to know i just need you to take care of it thank you what the hell is harvey doing he&amp;#39;s supposed to be deposing elliot perkins he&amp;#39;s with a client i don&amp;#39;t care we have a deposition don&amp;#39;t even try it louis i&amp;#39;m sorry let&amp;#39;s just start over okay hi donna hi you know i like you right but in the firm&amp;#39;s food chain i am a humpback whale and you are phytoplankton june rd that date means nothing to me doesn&amp;#39;t it who told you is the important thing how i know or that i know does harvey know he can i am going to pay you i just don&amp;#39;t have cash on me right now so i&amp;#39;m going to just tell norma to run her old ass out to the atm and bring it back in a jiff hmm all right i don&amp;#39;t want your money louis i just want you to i was not here i was not here i was not here all right let&amp;#39;s get started shall we isn&amp;#39;t harvey specter leading this deposition he sent me now mr perkins my first question to you is do you sleep well at night of course you do because you have a roof and a bed and running water and by contrast thousands of families are going to be sleeping on the street when stable shelters is forced to suspend their operations all because of the money that you stole i never stole anything you&amp;#39;re mazlo&amp;#39;s number two the money was embezzled do you deny that absolutely please robert i know as general counsel you just basically push paper but will you please warn mr perkins of the penalties of perjury look i&amp;#39;m not aware of any perjury we know about your account in the caymans twenty million dollars are you are you kidding me that transaction was legitimate oh when i take this public you&amp;#39;re going to be disgraced your wife your children your whole family disgraced would you show my client some respect and and that transaction had nothing to do with the firm bullshit you either took your cut from mazlo or it was hush money either way you&amp;#39;re going to live the rest of your life as a pariah or you give up mazlo now is this a deposition or an inquisition this is ridiculous i can show you the records oh sure you can because you&amp;#39;re the guy who invented losses in mortgage backed securities when you never even bought them i had no part in that but you were aware of it and you did nothing about it come on louis could i could i get a glass of water please you can&amp;#39;t get any water we don&amp;#39;t have any you give up mazlo now and this all stops all right look my client needs a break we can continue this in ten minutes i&amp;#39;m just getting started i don&amp;#39;t get it she looks so sweet don&amp;#39;t let the photo fool you she&amp;#39;s less girl next door more girl with the dragon tattoo hmm look my plate is full with stable shelters i need you to look into jerome&amp;#39;s daughter why didn&amp;#39;t he just hire a private investigator because if there&amp;#39;s a problem an investigator can&amp;#39;t fix it i&amp;#39;m not just a lawyer to jerome okay i&amp;#39;m i&amp;#39;m more like robert duvall in the godfather his consigliere okay what uh nothing just if you&amp;#39;re his robert duvall you&amp;#39;re coming to me so technically i&amp;#39;m your robert duvall you&amp;#39;re my fredo fredo no clear the hall please robert what the hell happened to perkins ask that pit bull of yours oh no actually i prefer a female masseuse is that can i call you right back right back okay bye perkins just got wheeled out on a stretcher well he couldn&amp;#39;t handle the heat he&amp;#39;s probably faking it what were you thinking starting that deposition without me i don&amp;#39;t know maybe if you were doing your job oh no what it&amp;#39;s from geller perkins wasn&amp;#39;t faking anything our best chance to nail anthony mazlo is dead see the money wanna stay for your meal get another piece of pie for your wife everybody wanna know how it feel everybody wanna see what it&amp;#39;s like i&amp;#39;ll even eat a bean pie i don&amp;#39;t mind me and missy is so early busy busy making money all right all step back i&amp;#39;m &amp;#39;bout to dance the greenback boogie well he blew off the deposition so i was just picking up the slack i was letting perkins sweat it was a tactic which you completely undermined well i believe i made him sweat and then some are you actually proud of what you did as far as i&amp;#39;m concerned whatever happened to that guy was a result of his own guilt and i will not apologize for deposing a criminal in a vigorous manner losing perkins is a complication we&amp;#39;re just going to have to work harder to unearth mazlo&amp;#39;s money trail as for what happened i&amp;#39;ve spoken to the hospital and the cause of death was a pulmonary embolism it was nothing you did would it be okay if i took the credit louis i need to have a word with harvey okay financial crime is that man&amp;#39;s forte yes he over stepped his rank but i&amp;#39;m not about to throw the baby out with the bathwater louis is the bathwater believe it or not harvey you can be a real pain in the ass to work with too oh i get along with me just fine yes well i&amp;#39;m not about to tell lucille jackson that we didn&amp;#39;t win because we couldn&amp;#39;t work together you need to figure out how to collaborate with louis so the name on lola jensen&amp;#39;s fake id wasn&amp;#39;t just pulled from thin air it belongs to an assistant controller at clarity drilling and you&amp;#39;re telling me this why you wanted me to look into it i didn&amp;#39;t ask you to explain the problem to me i asked you to fix it for me hey did louis really kill a guy is that what the associate rumor mill has been churning out actually i think he started it yeah he also claims to be &amp;#39; with a full head of hair louis with hair that&amp;#39;s good how did you get past donna you waited until she peed didn&amp;#39;t you i mean the woman retains water like a camel i see that the greatest band of all time is conspicuously absent and who would that be louis oh i don&amp;#39;t know a little british band called queen should have seen that coming you know real musicians they don&amp;#39;t wear eyeliner oh really why don&amp;#39;t you tell that to the artist formerly known as prince who is once again named prince what do you want louis well i think now that we&amp;#39;re working together we should set some ground rules first rule never touch my records or anything else in this office fine that includes the furniture i&amp;#39;m trying to build a rapport with you okay i mean i think our relationship needs a little work let&amp;#39;s hold off the couples counseling until our fifth anniversary don&amp;#39;t you think look mazlo&amp;#39;s lawyer moved to push up the trial they know we need time to cultivate another witness well i say we bluff i mean perkins implicated mazlo the minute his lawyer walked out of the room it&amp;#39;s hearsay louis not if it&amp;#39;s a deathbed confession maybe while geller was making the call i had a little conversation with perkins so you want to lie about what perkins said and how he said it well what&amp;#39;s your brilliant solution harvey i&amp;#39;m having the money in perkins&amp;#39; account traced as we speak and i have another witness in mind i get anthony mazlo across that table you know i&amp;#39;ll break him the way you broke perkins yeah if need be you&amp;#39;re not hearing me we need to hold off on any meeting i just want to know why that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s final louis question why would someone named lola jensen ever want to be known as mildred wisnewski who are you my name is mike ross i&amp;#39;m a lawyer let me guess pearson hardman you know forging a government document like this after is next to impossible god there must have been a glitch at the dmv why did you come here your father came to us because he&amp;#39;s worried about you if he was that worried he&amp;#39;d be here himself he wouldn&amp;#39;t have sent an empty suit you don&amp;#39;t know anything about me i on the other hand know that you used this id to funnel payments from clarity drilling to some fake company that you set up locksley llc you&amp;#39;re stealing money from your father&amp;#39;s company a couple million so far i don&amp;#39;t need to know why but i do need you to return it now actually you do need to know why this is groundwater from clarity&amp;#39;s fracking operation south of tulsa it&amp;#39;s got elevated levels of dibutoxyethanol methane and benzene this compares samples taken pre drilling to levels taken last week how did you get that that&amp;#39;s classified company data i&amp;#39;m good with computers wait a minute locksley llc as in robin of locksley as in robin hood these toxins are known to cause kidney failure liver cancer and infertility the epa fines were a slap on the wrist but the settlement that your firm negotiated with the victims it doesn&amp;#39;t matter how pure your motives are you&amp;#39;re committing a very serious crime threaten all you want okay there is no way that my father is going to let this go public right before his ipo i&amp;#39;m not giving the money back i&amp;#39;m giving it away in terms of living relatives i didn&amp;#39;t find anything but when i looked into the estates of relatives who&amp;#39;d passed away the holding was originally in the name of the aunt your theory on perkins was right harvey what are you doing rachel&amp;#39;s services are under my purview i&amp;#39;m sorry i&amp;#39;m going to change that anthony mazlo and his attorney are in the conference room at whose invitation oh what you think i called them you i i didn&amp;#39;t then mazlo feels he has an advantage and he&amp;#39;s pressing it hey fellows thanks for meeting us on such short notice i figured you&amp;#39;d be on a flight right now mr mazlo somewhere with no extradition agreement let&amp;#39;s get to the point without perkins you don&amp;#39;t have a case this report summarizes an internal investigation we conducted what inez has just handed you is hard evidence of fraudulent investments and fake losses perpetrated by perkins you guys have a real penchant for fiction don&amp;#39;t you no he duped all of us as ceo he betrayed me just as much as the investors we found an offshore account worth million just hold on a second lucille jackson trusted you to manage million endowment if perkins takes where the hell is the rest of it in light of these findings we&amp;#39;d like to offer a settlement yeah fifteen million ten cents on the dollar that&amp;#39;s a slap in the face well we advise all our clients that investments carry risk you want a risk free return buy treasury bills or i don&amp;#39;t know hide your money under the mattress while you were writing the great american novel i&amp;#39;ve been checking facts the million that perkins had overseas was legitimate he was innocent the money your firm embezzled is still out there and this so called investigation it isn&amp;#39;t worth the paper it&amp;#39;s printed on well lucille jackson may beg to differ counselor a bridge loan means she&amp;#39;s desperate our offer is non negotiable i won&amp;#39;t accept this offer today or a year from now now since you&amp;#39;ve all invited yourselves over feel free to see yourselves out so first you attack me for wanting to lie about perkins and then you turn around and do the same exact thing i wasn&amp;#39;t lying what are you saying to me harvey what the hell are you saying to me that perkins had no involvement whatsoever that&amp;#39;s exactly what i&amp;#39;m saying louis he was innocent huh it&amp;#39;s no surprise that mazlo low balled us i&amp;#39;m just passing along this offer as a formality fifteen million dollars is not insignificant but now is not the time to settle we have to strengthen our hand all right here&amp;#39;s my problem best case scenario we go to trial the jury awards us a settlement obviously mazlo appeals that it&amp;#39;s three years before i see any money and my foundation is long gone by that point no i&amp;#39;m not going to let mazlo pocket the lion&amp;#39;s share of your endowment i&amp;#39;m not interested in a pyrrhic victory neither are we and to prove it we&amp;#39;re going to forego our usual fee and return to you the money you&amp;#39;ve already paid i grew up sleeping in my mama&amp;#39;s car and in and out of more halfway houses than i can count and one thing i realized is that every penny matters so thank you what you going to do perkins may have been innocent but he was still mazlo&amp;#39;s direct report i&amp;#39;m going to find out what he knew thank you your job is to verify every detail of mazlo&amp;#39;s internal investigation it is not about the crime now it&amp;#39;s about the cover up this says perkins acted alone well he&amp;#39;s the perfect scapegoat he can&amp;#39;t defend himself you want to go to the bathroom you don&amp;#39;t bother coming back by the way that goes for personal phone calls emails and texts i detect a whiff of slacking you are done get it you find anything i&amp;#39;ll be in my office louis i&amp;#39;m still working on harvey&amp;#39;s case jerome jensen can go screw himself for all i care but harvey explicitly told me i don&amp;#39;t care if a burning bush told you mike the only commandments you need to focus on right now come from me there is something wrong with louis that&amp;#39;s not my problem i answer to harvey sitting home alone with your kids and no job harvey you solve jerome&amp;#39;s problem yet uh about to but i need your corporate card first what for well i thought you didn&amp;#39;t want me to explain it to you you&amp;#39;re right i don&amp;#39;t okay it&amp;#39;s killing you not knowing what i&amp;#39;m going to use this for isn&amp;#39;t it nope please let me tell you if you bring that back to me and it smells like stripper you&amp;#39;re fired i don&amp;#39;t i don&amp;#39;t go to places like that you had to send someone you couldn&amp;#39;t just call me if you wanted this to be private you should have just robbed me you robbed the company i had to involve other people okay why don&amp;#39;t we take a seat i think that we could probably why are you here i want to tell you my side of things okay i&amp;#39;m not proud of the fact that we contaminated people&amp;#39;s water but we apologized we implemented safeguards we negotiated a payout that was more than generous if that&amp;#39;s what you think then you are lying to yourself i think that we could keep this civil no she&amp;#39;s right it&amp;#39;s true i am lying to myself i thought this was a phase that uh it was hormones that it would pass but the truth is i raised a thief okay i think we&amp;#39;re going to need a minute thank you a thief my research is making the planet more habitable okay you are making money destroying it you have no respect for me that&amp;#39;s fine but at least respect the workers you&amp;#39;re stealing from them too you think i&amp;#39;m such a criminal arrest me so i organized this so that you two could clear the air but it seems we&amp;#39;ve gotten off on the wrong foot you know what it&amp;#39;s the same story as always dad you duck your responsibilities lola lola what if i paid the company back with my own money i don&amp;#39;t think that would be a very good idea it would make you a conspirator i&amp;#39;m not turning my daughter in to the police this is not about the company image well the good news is she hasn&amp;#39;t distributed the money yet the money is irrelevant i came to pearson hardman to take care of this instead my daughter and i are further apart than ever i can&amp;#39;t imagine how hard it is right now people are saying the most horrible things about elliot they must think i&amp;#39;ve gone deaf anthony mazlo has been dragging your husband&amp;#39;s name through the mud to make him a scapegoat mrs perkins i&amp;#39;m here to help i don&amp;#39;t understand you work for the other side i work for a charitable organization that had all its money stolen i&amp;#39;m on the other side of anthony mazlo not your husband and i don&amp;#39;t want to see his memory painted with the same brush what would i have to do this isn&amp;#39;t the time or the place no it&amp;#39;s okay what would i have to do i&amp;#39;d like to know everything elliot has ever told you about mazlo any details would help mrs perkins uh i&amp;#39;m louis litt and i just want to let you know that i&amp;#39;m going to do whatever it takes to clear your husband&amp;#39;s name his name my husband would be alive today if it weren&amp;#39;t for you we don&amp;#39;t know that i know what happened in that room well at the time we didn&amp;#39;t have all the facts but now we do i can&amp;#39;t believe that you have the audacity to come here i don&amp;#39;t ever want to see your face again and you can forget about me helping you what the hell are you doing i was deposing the widow just like you i came here to pay my respects and initiate a relationship not aggravate a grieving woman i brought flowers you just cost us a potential witness oh really well maybe maybe if you&amp;#39;d shared your game plan with me oh the same way that you shared your game plan with me how do you expect her to react to seeing you you need to get your shit together and find us a new witness lola i wanted to apologize for earlier today can i come in uh yeah of course nice gesture the botanical gardens oh yeah he said it was a pretty special place for you guys it was and then he became ceo but i&amp;#39;m not here to reminisce i must say i was really impressed you figured out what i was doing especially since you&amp;#39;re not even a real lawyer what are you what are you talking about i accessed harvard law school&amp;#39;s alumni directory every class that graduated for the last ten years no record of mike ross at all yeah the dean&amp;#39;s office was supposed to fix that they they put my name wrong in the system i checked your social security number against the database how did you get my social security number easily here&amp;#39;s the deal leave me alone or i expose you you don&amp;#39;t really seem that worried about this threats like hers are a tactic they&amp;#39;re effective because they distract you from what you&amp;#39;re supposed to be doing are you crazy what we should be doing is backing the hell off and how would that go huh jerome you came to us with a problem we discovered that your daughter stole million from your company and our conclusion is you&amp;#39;re shit out of luck i don&amp;#39;t really care how it would go all i care about is my life and keeping our secret i told you it&amp;#39;s a distraction she won&amp;#39;t pull that trigger why do you think she hasn&amp;#39;t distributed that money yet why do you think jerome doesn&amp;#39;t want us to go to the police i don&amp;#39;t know it&amp;#39;s because they both want to bury the hatchet and if any of that stuff happens they can&amp;#39;t then what figure out a way to make him reconcile it&amp;#39;s easy yeah it&amp;#39;s easy inez right louis litt i know who you are so is this what you do for mazlo you clean up his dirty laundry leave me alone you know you have your whole career ahead of you when mazlo goes down and you&amp;#39;re part of this cover up no one is going to hire you i can&amp;#39;t help you listen can i just tell you something inez in my experience people respond to two things okay and that&amp;#39;s the carrot and the stick now i prefer the stick and if you do not help me i will devote my considerable expertise to sticking it to you the same way you stuck it to perkins inez stop let&amp;#39;s go with the carrot inez harvey specter i appreciate you coming forward i should have done this sooner what changed i can&amp;#39;t be a part of a company like that anymore are you ready to testify against anthony mazlo in open court i am i assume you&amp;#39;ve documented his malfeasance because otherwise it&amp;#39;s he said she said the entire paper trail from the beginning all the way to last week harvey asked me to fix this problem with lola but i can&amp;#39;t because your daughter&amp;#39;s not the problem mr jensen you are are you trying to get fired no i&amp;#39;m not i&amp;#39;m your attorney it&amp;#39;s my job to give you advice but you&amp;#39;re her father it&amp;#39;s your job to raise her now you can go to another firm but there&amp;#39;s not a lawyer in the city that can do that job for you please don&amp;#39;t lecture me on parenting mr jensen i had a difficult relationship with my father so trust me when i tell you that lola wants to forgive you but she needs you to take the first step well we tried it your way we went to lunch and you saw how well that worked out my daughter is not a child she&amp;#39;s an adult she made these choices as an adult if you just found a way to you&amp;#39;re my lawyer this is a legal problem my daughter brought this on herself now i desperately do not want her to go to prison but if she doesn&amp;#39;t return the money she will thank you where&amp;#39;s mazlo he was afraid to face us himself what do you want we know about your entire scheme what scheme oh the scheme where mazlo is laundering money through dubai how do you know about dubai we cultivated another source what kind of settlement are you looking for one that includes punitive damages send inez in here please i don&amp;#39;t think you&amp;#39;ll find her at her desk why not because she agreed to testify for us i doubt that when your colleague approached her she came straight to us he even tried to bribe me he said if i ratted out mr mazlo he&amp;#39;d get me a job as an assistant to jessica pearson everything she told you was a complete fabrication there is no dubai i seem to recall you mentioning something about penalties for perjury at our last meeting well the penalty for bribing a witness is just as severe and we&amp;#39;re willing to overlook that indiscretion if you convince your client to take our settlement offer well our revised settlement offer revised yes exactly half of what it was before what the hell were you thinking we needed a new witness you didn&amp;#39;t think to look into her story i don&amp;#39;t know did you look into it you were the one who brought her in i assumed you had like any halfway decent lawyer would we were under the gun and i was under strict instructions from my golf pro to get another witness no i told you to get another witness not bribe one that&amp;#39;s enough as for the threat against louis no money changed hands i&amp;#39;m not concerned with louis he brought your name into it okay the offer was to be your assistant now you&amp;#39;re exposed because of what he did is that true she is an executive assistant to the head of a major investment firm she&amp;#39;s not going to work for a junior partner so you tried to bribe her no it wasn&amp;#39;t a bribe jessica it was an incentive i thought she&amp;#39;d be more likely to talk if she wasn&amp;#39;t worried about being fired i want you to go to mazlo and take their offer i&amp;#39;m not ready to do that i&amp;#39;m not either i waived lucille&amp;#39;s fee because a certain senior partner said we&amp;#39;d never go to trial i said that before you stuck me with louis not the point she can&amp;#39;t afford it and neither can we give me time give it to me without louis and we&amp;#39;ll see who can afford it and who can&amp;#39;t you have until the end of the day you come up empty i&amp;#39;m taking the offer to lucille myself jessica i went to perkins&amp;#39; widow not another word you try something like that again and it will be your last day at this firm you said jerome wouldn&amp;#39;t pull the trigger you were wrong he&amp;#39;s ready i don&amp;#39;t have time for that right now harvey when the police show up at lola&amp;#39;s doorstep we&amp;#39;re done has she distributed the money yet no she hasn&amp;#39;t but she&amp;#39;s about she hasn&amp;#39;t and she won&amp;#39;t because what she wants is her daddy&amp;#39;s attention now sit down with me and let&amp;#39;s deal with this yeah yeah sure why don&amp;#39;t you tell me what you need mazlo was in liechtenstein the day that lucille&amp;#39;s endowment evaporated yeah maybe he was skiing nobody goes to liechtenstein for pleasure why don&amp;#39;t we subpoena the bank records how many banks can there be that place is like switzerland on steroids we&amp;#39;ll never see those records so what the hell do you want from me then what did you just say to me i once suggested that we hack harvard&amp;#39;s records to cover my ass and you laughed at me and now it turns out that you were wrong and it&amp;#39;s about to cost me my career where are you going you told me to fix my case why don&amp;#39;t you fix yours i hope you came here to tell me harvey&amp;#39;s backing off i wish i could but he&amp;#39;s not that&amp;#39;s too bad you had such a promising career god lola you act like you care about a higher cause but of all the companies that exist you chose your dad&amp;#39;s a company that&amp;#39;s trying to make amends for what it did i really don&amp;#39;t need to hear another speech from a wannabe suit god you think i&amp;#39;m your enemy huh well i&amp;#39;m not i didn&amp;#39;t even come here to talk to you about me or your father new york iowa kansas forty states that all have housing projects that will vanish if we don&amp;#39;t find out information that only you can help us get so you can steal money from your father&amp;#39;s company or you can blow the whistle on me if you want to but if you really care about people the way that you claim to you&amp;#39;re going to do this first are we close i&amp;#39;m accessing the banks through a server in china unless you&amp;#39;d rather me use yours take your time done all right there are banks in liechtenstein this is every account in every single one of them none of the accounts is listed under anthony mazlo forget about the name find an account with million embezzled from stable shelters on that date harvey it&amp;#39;s time unless you have something i&amp;#39;m calling lucille to settle jessica you know how liechtenstein doesn&amp;#39;t respond to subpoenas so i responded for them just trust me we&amp;#39;ve got everything we need to find lucille&amp;#39;s money it&amp;#39;s not here sounds like you need more than just another minute you need another person someone whose expertise is financial crime no no harvey bring in louis or i&amp;#39;m calling lucille donna i need to talk to louis he&amp;#39;s not in his office huh norma wouldn&amp;#39;t tell you where he is well she didn&amp;#39;t um you didn&amp;#39;t ask her did you that woman she gives me the creeps oh you&amp;#39;re such a wuss what did you just say to me i think we both know what i just said norma where is he what you&amp;#39;re kidding what shh i come here when i need to be alone magnum really you feeling lucky today punk you know i understand that me pissing the bed on this case must be really really fun for you no louis it&amp;#39;s not the one thing you and i have in common is we need to win i noticed that and i came here because even after everything we can win no i can watch while you win louis i&amp;#39;m not here to give you shit listen i respect you i bribed a witness you incentivized her i went to see perkins&amp;#39; widow to apologize i killed a man that you thought had it coming i don&amp;#39;t think you heard what i said i respect you you need my help i wouldn&amp;#39;t phrase it exactly like that well if you need my help you better phrase it exactly like that okay you want me to say it i&amp;#39;ll say it i&amp;#39;m under the gun and i need your help i&amp;#39;ve got the information but you&amp;#39;ve got the financial expertise to break this case now let&amp;#39;s put the gun down and go get him okay first just stand over there for a second don&amp;#39;t push it so what was the exact amount of money that was lost from stable shelters&amp;#39; account why i&amp;#39;m good with numbers huh all right what do you have we&amp;#39;ve compiled a printout of every account that had a deposit made on the day in question in all of liechtenstein&amp;#39;s banks okay well we are going to focus on excuse me these five banks how can you be sure watch this these four banks have a history of capitulating to subpoenas so mazlo would know these six have us corporate parents which would expose their accounts to federal scrutiny once again mazlo would know and then the one that he&amp;#39;s got right there is low in reserves therefore its solvency is in question and there is no way in hell that mazlo would take his stolen money and put it into some shaky bank so we can be sure every person who embezzles money they do it in their own way but the one thing that they all have in common is that they never put all their eggs in one basket so we are going to be looking at a combination of accounts across banks well i mean maybe across banks maybe the same bank but we&amp;#39;re definitely looking at more than one account ooh how do we figure out which accounts are his because they&amp;#39;re all going to add up to the same exact amount of money that was lost from stable shelters&amp;#39; account well how do you know when the account was drained it had to go somewhere what goes out from lucille&amp;#39;s had to go into mazlo&amp;#39;s simple law of mathematics so we just have to figure out a combination of accounts that adds up to i&amp;#39;m good with numbers too thanks for meeting us on such short notice i assume you&amp;#39;re ready to take our offer i rushed right down well we just have a few questions before we get to any of that we didn&amp;#39;t agree to answer any questions no no robert it&amp;#39;s okay i&amp;#39;m happy to play have you ever been to liechtenstein mr mazlo you know i&amp;#39;ve been to many places among them liechtenstein really well of those many places did you open seven different bank accounts the amounts of which add up to exactly the same amount of money that disappeared from lucille jackson&amp;#39;s endowment fund i doubt it what i don&amp;#39;t doubt is that if you trace the money that went into those accounts you&amp;#39;ll find that it came from our corporate offices in sri lanka it&amp;#39;s completely legitimate i mean i&amp;#39;m happy to show you the records whenever you&amp;#39;d like oh that&amp;#39;s great isn&amp;#39;t that great well after that can you show us the records of the seven safety deposit boxes that you opened at those same banks the same day i don&amp;#39;t have to answer that this isn&amp;#39;t a deposition you&amp;#39;re so right it&amp;#39;s more of a presentation we can make it a deposition or a trial up to you we have pictures of you entering those banks and we have enough to crack their subpoenas it&amp;#39;s just a matter of time tony all right what do you want what do i want well it&amp;#39;s not about me it&amp;#39;s about lucille she wants your head on a stick but she&amp;#39;ll settle for her money back and your resignation we agree right here no criminal prosecution done if lucille doesn&amp;#39;t get her money back today nothing&amp;#39;s done great that&amp;#39;s perfect you are back in business the wire transfer just went through girl you came through that is what we do harvey harvey get in here lucille wants to thank you in person i&amp;#39;ve always got time for gratitude harvey you didn&amp;#39;t let me settle and i appreciate your tenacity the truth is i didn&amp;#39;t do this on my own have you met louis litt you guys are doing such good work i just want you to know it dean waiser have i told you how valuable you are to this company because you&amp;#39;re not just kidding janice i want you to

you out of anything man i thought we were a team i thought this was the start of something but i louis now i see the truth all too clearly louis i was walking by and they called me in yeah just in time to take the credit for what i did i didn&amp;#39;t do that i wouldn&amp;#39;t even think of doing that but you know what you would and that&amp;#39;s your problem right there i got your email

fresh cup you actually going to buy it this time or are you going to steal it okay first of all i don&#x27;t steal i cheat there&#x27;s a big difference and i don&#x27;t do it anymore oh great defense i&#x27;m sorry your honor i know that i murdered her but i promise i won&#x27;t do it anymore look i understand why you&#x27;re mad but i still don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re being entirely fair not fair what&#x27;s not fair is that you repeatedly help people skirt a system that stands in the way of me becoming a lawyer you know what why don&#x27;t you give up the whole saint act since the only reason you figured out i was cheating is because you were thinking about cheating yourself thinking about cheating and actually doing it are two very different things dr analogy oh whoa did i miss an apocalypse where is everyone you know for someone with a freak brain you manage to forget everything important follow me but don&#x27;t talk to me oh not bad harvey the prague hotel in the black in

honestly believe that i&#x27;d do that without talking to you first i know you would then perhaps i did jones if you try to pursue a merger you may not control what happens to your business that you built so passionately okay sherlock hear me out combined we&#x27;re hotels in countries i like having multiple homes but you don&#x27;t need another name on the mortgage it&#x27;s a good deal yeah and it&#x27;s my job to get you a better one okay promise me you didn&#x27;t do a handshake deal donna who&#x27;s ready for mock trial  what like make believe trials are we going to play monopoly after this is your debutante ball the impression you make on the partners will last and let me guess harvey was oh legendary shocking sydney thompson was a consultant with lunders global initiative she had a few too many and decided to entertain her friends with an impersonation of her boss lena lunders this impersonation was recorded and uploaded onto a social networking site the next day she was fired sydney is now suing for wrongful termination can&#x27;t cheat your way out of this one the partners have been instructed to only use the associates in emergency situations let the games begin all right when your name is called please step up and meet your match i think you mean my bitch louis ooh jean kaplan i&#x27;m glad jessica finally chose a case with a strong female character last year i was forced to play a traffic cop it was a total waste of my talent wait a minute you play witnesses oh i don&#x27;t play anything i embody and if i&#x27;m on your team you&#x27;re a winner well in that case no okay kyle durant mike ross mike ross kyle for the plaintiff ross for the defendant may the best man win oh by the way kyle weren&#x27;t you a national mock trial champion that&#x27;s right louis in high school college and law school see the money wanna stay for your meal get another piece of pie for your wife everybody wanna know how it feel everybody wanna see what it&#x27;s like

vega&#x27;s hotels okay i want you to check annual earnings property value you should be writing yeah this all doesn&#x27;t sound like an emergency the mock trial okay i&#x27;m on it uh listen harvey about i don&#x27;t give advice okay please sensei i&#x27;m out of my league with this thing listen to me don&#x27;t go to trial it&#x27;s a mock trial i think the trial part is kind of a prerequisite all right law is about control okay you can only control so much with a jury judge witnesses and another lawyer with an ego complex what if the lawyer doesn&#x27;t have an ego complex every lawyer has an ego complex the firm has presented an exercise where there&#x27;s potential for failure okay all i&#x27;m saying is try and create a situation where that&#x27;s not even a possibility kobayashi maru koba what now star trek captain kirk he wins a no win situation by rewriting the rules you&#x27;re a trekkie hey captain kirk is the man okay i don&#x27;t want to hear another word about it now enough with your fake law problem let&#x27;s deal with my real one aye aye captain you want to know how to do a cross some people like to use big words some people like to go for sympathy but personally i&#x27;m a little more go for the groin oh hey mike you mind dismissing the peanut gallery so we can talk kyle i&#x27;m sorry guys looks like ross here came to plead for mercy if you&#x27;re here for the witness exhibit exchange don&#x27;t bother i already know who you&#x27;re going to call and what evidence you&#x27;re going to use actually i&#x27;m not going to call any witnesses or present any evidence let&#x27;s settle or i could beat you the plaintiff has shown a pattern of making derogatory statements about my client hearsay not the emails which have no tone of voice and are subject to interpretation which is exactly why your argument is shaky at best then beat me in court kyle there is a reason that harvey chose me to be his guy do you really want to find out what that reason is and how do i know this isn&#x27;t some sort of trick it&#x27;s not a trick it&#x27;s just our chance to stand out look settling gets us in and out of there in five minutes you drop the suit and you and i spend the rest of the week making ourselves indispensable to the partners while everyone else buries their heads in candy land court i&#x27;m going against my better judgment and trusting you so we have a deal daniel the paperwork looks good despite the fact that you two decided to go lawyer commando but the devil&#x27;s always in the details harvey i know that impulse purchases don&#x27;t exist in your world but the timing was right and as for the details i like to leave that to my man scott does he always like to be late she just got off a plane from london meet ms dana scott welcome hi thank you scottie harvey oh you two know each other we went to harvard law together harvey was fifth in the class and i was oh i forget what was it married to the library that&#x27;s right number one number one at studying okay this way tell me scottie what&#x27;s my success rate against you in the real world where we practice real law oh harvey there should be no winners or losers in a merger just a happy new couple that&#x27;s right and  well i say we let these two talk deal points while i try your chef&#x27;s famous sea bass absolutely play nice we like each other even if you two don&#x27;t married to the library  it&#x27;s not my fault the library was the best you could do do you have the preliminary proposal no i just flew in from london completely unprepared try not to be intimidated i used some big words overcompensation isn&#x27;t that big of a word it isn&#x27;t i can hardly wait to see the work of a senior partner i see my promotion popped up on your harvey specter google alert that&#x27;s not all that&#x27;s going to pop up can&#x27;t remember the last time we had a bed pretty convenient that we&#x27;re working on a hotel merger remember the mining deal shaft  how could i forget listen about the due diligence uh uh uh harvey you know the rules no case negotiations until we&#x27;re done i think that might be a while oh couldn&#x27;t resist seeing brilliance in action huh actually i have to be here i&#x27;m playing the part of the plaintiff wow i knew you were pissed but i didn&#x27;t realize you were petty what does that mean it&#x27;s an adjective it means small minded spiteful okay you chose to work with the one guy who&#x27;s going against me kyle asked me and i said yes you know what it doesn&#x27;t really matter because you&#x27;re never going to take the stand really how&#x27;s that it&#x27;s a surprise prepare to watch a mock trial legend be born is counsel ready to proceed with opening statements we&#x27;d like to submit a settlement agreement plaintiff is ready your honor which is it counselor um the counsel for the plaintiff and i agreed to a settlement yesterday he must have misunderstood we had discussed but i never agreed to anything do you have a signed agreement uh i no then we are ready to proceed you have the floor thank you on march st  sydney thompson was unwittingly recorded on a cell phone she made a joke the type of joke that i&#x27;m sure every person in this courtroom has made at one point or another and yet she was fired she was denied severance mr ross mr ross are you ready um the uh the defense uh according to bowmaster v whitely if the party to a settlement is surprised by the repudiation of the settlement then the court must provide a reasonable amount of time to prepare for the trial reasonable time yes your honor you get five minutes vega has more property debeque has more potential which is harder to monetarily define this isn&#x27;t the library scottie my guy is an up and comer that&#x27;s why your guy is pouncing your client is an impulse shopper which is what may have made him a quick success but could make him an even faster failure so he&#x27;s a passionate guy he falls in love with a city and he builds himself a hotel who are you to argue with his track record i&#x27;m a realist and i have never seen a deal pushed through so quickly so what so your guy might wake up tomorrow and decide that he doesn&#x27;t want to do this which is why i&#x27;m not showing you our private books without a signed deal is that a joke am i laughing look i may not have been awake during our m a clinic except for when you were copying my notes which was no walk in the park you write like a monkey but in any case due diligence is a requirement i have an obligation to my client then we don&#x27;t have a deal and everyone&#x27;s going to know it&#x27;s because you killed it you know i don&#x27;t see you rushing to show us your private books i have nothing to hide you can have full access to our books right now great you show me yours and i&#x27;ll show you mine don&#x27;t say it harvey mike hey are you okay now you care mr ross i&#x27;m going to have to ask you not to speak to my client she&#x27;s not your client she is rachel the paralegal and i only have five minutes so you should really get out of my face what&#x27;s your problem mike my problem is that you don&#x27;t have the balls to make this a fair fight kyle lawyering isn&#x27;t about fighting fair and you better watch your false accusations or i might just sue you for defamation come on the defendant wishes to countersue on what grounds i believe that&#x27;s my line counselor defamation of character the plaintiff&#x27;s video negatively impacted the perception of lena lunders and impaired her financial well being that&#x27;s ridiculous your honor in order for there to be defamation the statements made would have had to have been false that&#x27;s not the case here then you should have no problem proving that in court the countersuit is allowed are you serious would you like to approach the bench and find out how serious i am your honor the defense should have filed counterclaims before the trial began yes he should have but no one in this crop of associates had the foresight to do so and we drafted a whole addendum just because we assumed one of you would so i&#x27;m going to allow it do you have a problem with that no your honor this is now a defamation trial you have until friday to prepare nice recovery thinking on your feet but you wouldn&#x27;t have had to if you hadn&#x27;t been so naive thank you your honor how did the negotiation go you come out on top why didn&#x27;t you tell me scottie was opposing counsel because i didn&#x27;t want you to have performance anxiety about the case she&#x27;s tough you&#x27;re obvious and your fly is unzipped no it isn&#x27;t but it was earlier today you can do better ooh is that what scottie said type up the deal points i got her to cave debeque&#x27;s going to run the show all i had to do was show her our books i can&#x27;t believe it you gave me like the worst advice anyone&#x27;s ever given another person take the drama down a notch juliet i tried to settle and i got completely blind sided i told you to settle i didn&#x27;t tell you to be stupid what do you think is going to happen in the real world you have to be prepared for anything well in the real world i won&#x27;t have to be looking for someone to play my fake witness in my fake trial wait wait wait wait what do you think you think witnesses are just going to jump up and present themselves because they&#x27;re not and sometimes when you have one they disappear or recant and you know what you do you deal with it mock trial is about figuring out what type of lawyer you want to be and there&#x27;s only two types winners and losers okay that sounds great harvey but i haven&#x27;t prepared i don&#x27;t have anyone to play my client or my witness and apparently i&#x27;m going up against someone that i can&#x27;t trust figure out a way to beat him anyway winners don&#x27;t make excuses when the other side plays the game hey donna i proofed that final agreement on the hotel merger quick question has harvey ever heard of spell check oh my god sorry are you no no no it&#x27;s okay no no you don&#x27;t have to cry it&#x27;s okay it&#x27;s okay he says things sometimes and they and they cut to the bone he does it to me too i know he says the it&#x27;s not bad right i can also do the demi moore single tear left eye or right eye if that&#x27;s better for the character okay i&#x27;m scared what&#x27;s going on if i&#x27;m going to play lena lunders for you i need to be able to use my full range of emotions oh my god i love you yeah i know focus you need another witness and at this point everybody else in the firm is booked up aw is mommy helping you clean up your mess ross am i mommy in this scenario what uh ross is just a baby oh my god i cannot believe i&#x27;m going to lose to that tool okay come on no pity parties go to an outside source for the other witness for the best friend you need somebody pretty sympathetic and most importantly willing to go above and beyond for you what are you doing here jenny come on i need your help i&#x27;ve got nowhere else to go you yelled at me kissed me pushed me away disappeared i haven&#x27;t talked to you in forever i don&#x27;t even know what&#x27;s going on in your life well if you let me in i&#x27;ll explain and i promise it&#x27;s a really good story so you&#x27;ve been living a lie this whole time yeah that&#x27;s awesome really yeah i mean as far as double lives go you&#x27;re maybe not as cool as clark kent still clark kent mmm hmm okay you&#x27;re cut off mmm what nothing it just feels really good to tell you i don&#x27;t really have anybody i can talk to about it you trust me yeah i guess i do i like that ooh i really like this hmm i&#x27;ve got to hand it to you harvey you may not be able to commit to a woman but you have been in this place a very long time she gets me and has no needs i don&#x27;t think you understand how high maintenance this place is he agreed to all your terms despite my protests that he could do better so we&#x27;re done minus a few signatures that&#x27;s not done want me to leave ladies and gentlemen of the jury please note can i ask a question no you can&#x27;t ask questions as a witness don&#x27;t ask questions ladies and gentlemen yeah i know that but um what are you doing what do you mean you&#x27;re walking around like you have a giant stick up your ass it&#x27;s a trial jenny i i have to be powerful but that&#x27;s not you thanks no you are charming and funny and trustworthy that&#x27;s your power and that&#x27;s great when i&#x27;m trying to con my way into the lsats but this is a courtroom it&#x27;s useless there but it&#x27;s still you so take a deep breath just talk to me ask me where do i work where do you work lunders global initiative ask me how i know sydney how do you know sydney she was my friend and i&#x27;ve missed her every day that she&#x27;s been gone and why aren&#x27;t you friends anymore i don&#x27;t know if you do it like that they&#x27;ll fall in love with you scottie that was amazing careful harvey you need to hydrate you just ran a marathon and i think you just beat me uh oh that&#x27;s a lawyer look law school post mock trial in the library second circuit court of appeals class action on the prep room table dempsey settlement in my office on the desk and under so what are we doing a highlight reel as a matter of fact we are those were top moments right they weren&#x27;t bad no they were great and i just realized this was better you were the best you&#x27;ve ever been and i know why why you hid something from me in the negotiation and i want to know what you know what you are ridiculous uh you know what don&#x27;t do that okay do what you think i don&#x27;t know victory sex when i see it huh see it what is it one of vega&#x27;s properties is bankrupt the buenos aires one what uh what do you want me to say harvey you yes you got me i screwed you how oh my god you want an anatomy lesson now that&#x27;s my shirt consider it a winner&#x27;s reward hey harvey you were right there&#x27;s been a steady stream of stock buying by vega&#x27;s company in the last hours it&#x27;s a hostile takeover yeah but why are they disguising it as a merger they wanted access to our private books she tricked me what she pretended she didn&#x27;t want to hand over their books so i wouldn&#x27;t notice when she asked for ours it&#x27;s a classic maneuver she made me think it was my idea how do you know that because i taught her how to do it so now they see how strong debeque&#x27;s company is and they want to buy it and they&#x27;ll be running it by the time scottie&#x27;s back in london wow i leave you alone for two days this is my mistake this is halley&#x27;s comet take a good look because it won&#x27;t happen again so what are you going to do i want to know which of debeque&#x27;s hotels are the most valuable and how fast we can get them on the market wait you want debeque to sell his best hotels it&#x27;s called the crown jewel defense we unload the highest grossing assets and we make ourselves look undesirable debeque will never agree to that trust me debeque has enough passion for his company that he&#x27;ll be willing to chop off an arm to save the body okay you know you had that memorized the first time you read it right yeah but i didn&#x27;t finish reading it because a certain witness chose to be distracting that must have been rough for you yeah you have no idea where can i get some water i need to make sure my voice holds up right there i&#x27;ll make you a deal winner gets the girl you know i&#x27;m never going to make another deal with you again hey they remind me of a younger less attractive you and me please don&#x27;t say things like that and i know that you rigged the lottery so that mike would get kyle please rigged expedited they&#x27;re all just words besides don&#x27;t you want to see what your boy is made of you talking bet yeah usual amount i believe we have a wager some of us shower before we go to work mr specter you know what save it right how are you feeling good good yeah good is it inappropriate to take a xanax if you&#x27;re a witness in a trial i&#x27;ve seen clients do much worse actually i&#x27;m not a client i&#x27;m a witness in a friend&#x27;s mock trial one thing if you get into trouble don&#x27;t play the case play the man what are you talking about good lawyers worry about facts great lawyers worry about their opponents kyle is cocky and devious figure out a way to use that against him okay anything else kick his ass who&#x27;s your friend uh mike ross do you know him uh yeah uh it&#x27;s a big firm but i know who he is yeah god i don&#x27;t know why i&#x27;m so nervous i just know this is a big deal to him and i don&#x27;t want to let him down hmm sydney thompson was at a party and made a joke it wasn&#x27;t meant to be mean or to be taken as fact and it most certainly was never meant to be public the defense will show that sydney thompson chose to publicly defame her boss with an impression that she knew would be damaging both to lena lunders&#x27; reputation and her company i call lena lunders to the stand uh do you need a minute no i can continue thank you please i&#x27;m a self made woman i created the global initiative to target problems in third world countries i take my work very seriously and if a joke can be made of that fine but as a woman in power people look at your success and label you they don&#x27;t know the complexity it takes for a woman to succeed in this business and when someone undermines that well we have to fight for ourselves don&#x27;t we your honor objection so it&#x27;s hard to be a woman in business that has nothing to do with the facts of this case we can only understand the damage your client has done by fully understanding the care with which ms lunders has built her reputation um i&#x27;m sorry can you ask me the question one more time take a deep breath it&#x27;s just you and me we&#x27;re just going to have a conversation about your job okay yeah okay how do you know the defendant sydney thompson we were coworkers we started at the same level and then i was promoted to be her immediate superior and do you know about the video in question yes i was at the party that night and what were you celebrating that night my promotion same night that&#x27;s interesting ms ginnesse what did you think of the impersonation it was too far it was mean so why do you think ms thompson did it ms lunders promoted me sydney hated it and that&#x27;s why she made the video well thank you ms ginnesse nothing further your honor did sydney ever tell you that she hated your promotion not exactly yes or no please no well then how do you know that she hated your promotion i could just tell can you tell what i&#x27;m thinking right now that you&#x27;re wishing i would agree with everything you say no i was thinking that if you could actually read my mind i wouldn&#x27;t bother asking you questions but you can&#x27;t read my mind can you no i&#x27;m a managing director not a magician no and i&#x27;m pretty sure you can&#x27;t read sydney&#x27;s either and you actually have no idea why she made that video correct i guess i don&#x27;t no good afternoon ms scott thank you are you here to give me a proper send off i don&#x27;t think we can do that out here on the street you sure you tricked me i&#x27;m impressed to be fair vega did want a merger i just convinced him that given your client&#x27;s propensity for rash purchases that allowing him to stay in charge was a bad idea vega needed debeque&#x27;s hotels minus debeque and i found a way one that he never asked for or wanted and one that he&#x27;s never going to get is is this for real three of debeque&#x27;s properties that will be on the market by the end of day he&#x27;s never going to let you sell off his crown jewels see that&#x27;s the thing about passionate clients when they&#x27;re crossed they get angry and they&#x27;ll do anything to get back don&#x27;t do this harvey look there&#x27;s another way we can do this we can get our clients into a room together you can tell them you were wrong and we can convince them back into a merger ms thompson what was the intent behind your impersonation i was just trying to be funny everyone in our office makes jokes as a matter of fact ms lunders encourages us to be informal i can&#x27;t win this just on the facts but i expected it i think everyone has the impulse to move up and at a certain point you just have to let it go so that&#x27;s what i did what are you going to do i&#x27;m going to play the woman not the case you say you expected to be passed over for a promotion correct yes and yet you applied three times yes and you were never promoted as i said yes when nora ginnesse was promoted you wrote scathing emails to the rest of your coworkers in response not scathing the intent was to be funny oh right you like to be funny who doesn&#x27;t like to laugh someone whose reputation has been ruined objection just a thought he&#x27;s testifying sustained mr ross questions i&#x27;m sorry your honor forgive me i was just trying to be funny on your performance review lena lunders wrote good work ethic lacks skills do you think that&#x27;s a fair assessment fair i i don&#x27;t know your coworkers were promoted and your boss was calling you mediocre are you mediocre no so why haven&#x27;t you been promoted i don&#x27;t know do you think you deserve better doesn&#x27;t everyone so why haven&#x27;t you tried i have tried why haven&#x27;t you improved i didn&#x27;t say i haven&#x27;t improved well your review did your five years without a promotion did look you were so angry that you weren&#x27;t moving forward that you lashed out at your boss objection testifying no and everyone was moving past you so what people making good on their potential badgering your honor people who can cut it i can cut it excuse me your honor settlement&#x27;s still on the table what let&#x27;s settle same deal win win no i&#x27;m good excuse me i&#x27;ve seen the dreamy looks ross you like her so you&#x27;re offering me a settlement because you don&#x27;t want to hurt her feelings but i&#x27;d rather see if you&#x27;ll break her giddy up cowboy counselor would you like to proceed no your honor are you sure yes your honor nothing further well normally we&#x27;d move on to closing statements but it&#x27;s been a long week and honestly we all know where this is going so the court rules in favor of the defendant court is adjourned mr ross naive and soft not qualities we&#x27;re looking for at pearson hardman gentlemen i appreciate you leaving the swords at home what started off as a true merger never needed to become anything different daniel i want you to listen to me i know harvey and he just wants to merge your businesses so he can double his billable hours quiet scott i want to hear what he has to say i&#x27;m just here to get my client the deal that he wants and what he wants is a merger is that right jones that&#x27;s right daniel your law firm overreached in a situation where it wasn&#x27;t necessary it&#x27;s not entirely scottie&#x27;s fault we lawyers all have an instinct to win but sometimes we may not fully understand what that means we understand what it means well maybe you do and maybe you don&#x27;t for me it would be to see both men return to the initial deal so that you can grow both your businesses instead of having one company with a hostile reputation and the other a shell of what it once was i mean that doesn&#x27;t sound like a win to me i&#x27;m sorry let&#x27;s just go back to the original deal we can run it together you need anything because otherwise i&#x27;m going to head out celebratory drinks with the associates yep and what exactly are you celebrating you know what you can save the disappointment harvey i know what i did do you because what i saw is that you backed off because you were worried about hurting your girlfriend&#x27;s feelings it was a fake trial all right i weighed the pros and the cons and i decided it wasn&#x27;t worth hurting someone for the result the result is you just told every partner in this firm including myself that you have a weak stomach you don&#x27;t have what it takes you know you keep telling me that i have to decide what kind of lawyer i want to be and if i were smart i&#x27;d probably be just like you because everybody knows you&#x27;re the best but i&#x27;m also trying to decide what kind of person i want to be and sometimes i like my kind of person a lot more than yours you want to know what kind of person i am tough but fair i call it like i see it and what i see is a kid who asked for an opportunity and still hasn&#x27;t decided if he wants it or not single malt please harvard club i thought you hate this place vega kicked me out of his hotel so you know beggars save the pout you were head of law review you clerked for a supreme court judge and you almost beat me i think that deserves a drink on you i&#x27;d laugh but i just got fired from the firm no but the firm is not going to be happy that&#x27;s why i&#x27;m not already on a plane hey the scottie i know is tougher than that is she whoa you want to go back to our alma mater and see a lecture on why women are better at science might cheer you up maybe but i&#x27;m not going with you come on we&#x27;re still friends i&#x27;m getting married harvey his name is steve and uh he asked me a month ago and um when i get back to london i&#x27;m i&#x27;m going to say yes what would you like me to say nothing come here i&#x27;m sorry i won no harvey i would hate it if you were sorry about that you didn&#x27;t have to do that you know i know i could have handled it i know that was a thank you if you couldn&#x27;t tell i could tell so um jenny was a great witness really likable and pretty yeah yeah she is i know i was hard on you this week it&#x27;s okay rachel no it did you ever take a minute to wonder why i was so mad at you i just expect more from you than most people why you&#x27;re a smart guy you can figure it out&quot;&gt; god i&amp;#39;m so sorry are you okay you know there are easier ways to kill me if you&amp;#39;re worried i&amp;#39;ll rat you out for cheating on the lsats what come on rachel unbelievable rachel oh god rachel come on let me buy you a fresh cup you actually going to buy it this time or are you going to steal it okay first of all i don&amp;#39;t steal i cheat there&amp;#39;s a big difference and i don&amp;#39;t do it anymore oh great defense i&amp;#39;m sorry your honor i know that i murdered her but i promise i won&amp;#39;t do it anymore look i understand why you&amp;#39;re mad but i still don&amp;#39;t think you&amp;#39;re being entirely fair not fair what&amp;#39;s not fair is that you repeatedly help people skirt a system that stands in the way of me becoming a lawyer you know what why don&amp;#39;t you give up the whole saint act since the only reason you figured out i was cheating is because you were thinking about cheating yourself thinking about cheating and actually doing it are two very different things dr analogy oh whoa did i miss an apocalypse where is everyone you know for someone with a freak brain you manage to forget everything important follow me but don&amp;#39;t talk to me oh not bad harvey the prague hotel in the black in less than three years and a successful ipo who said passion wasn&amp;#39;t productive i don&amp;#39;t know anyone that&amp;#39;s ever said that jones tell me something hmm you have hotels in different countries but you spent last week in daniel vega&amp;#39;s lisbon resort well just you know checking out the competition that was more than a fact finding mission you&amp;#39;re thinking merger do you honestly believe that i&amp;#39;d do that without talking to you first i know you would then perhaps i did jones if you try to pursue a merger you may not control what happens to your business that you built so passionately okay sherlock hear me out combined we&amp;#39;re hotels in countries i like having multiple homes but you don&amp;#39;t need another name on the mortgage it&amp;#39;s a good deal yeah and it&amp;#39;s my job to get you a better one okay promise me you didn&amp;#39;t do a handshake deal donna who&amp;#39;s ready for

shocking sydney thompson was a consultant with lunders global initiative she had a few too many and decided to entertain her friends with an impersonation of her boss lena lunders this impersonation was recorded and uploaded onto a social networking site the next day she was fired sydney is now suing for wrongful termination can&amp;#39;t cheat your way out of this one the partners have been instructed to only use the associates in emergency situations let the games begin all right when your name is called please step up and meet your match i think you mean my bitch louis ooh jean kaplan

i&amp;#39;m out of my league with this thing listen to me don&amp;#39;t go to trial it&amp;#39;s a mock trial i think the trial part is kind of a prerequisite all right law is about control okay you can only control so much with a jury judge witnesses and another lawyer with an ego complex what if the lawyer doesn&amp;#39;t have an ego complex every lawyer has an ego complex the firm has presented an exercise where there&amp;#39;s potential for failure okay all i&amp;#39;m saying is try and create a situation where that&amp;#39;s not even a possibility kobayashi maru koba what now star trek captain kirk he wins a no win situation by rewriting the rules you&amp;#39;re a trekkie hey captain kirk is the man okay i don&amp;#39;t want to hear another word about it now enough with your fake law problem let&amp;#39;s deal with my real one aye aye captain you want to know how to do a cross some people like to use big words some people like to go for sympathy but personally i&amp;#39;m a little more go for the groin oh hey mike you mind dismissing the peanut gallery so we can talk kyle i&amp;#39;m sorry guys looks like ross here came to plead for mercy if you&amp;#39;re here for the witness exhibit exchange don&amp;#39;t bother i already know who you&amp;#39;re going to call and what evidence you&amp;#39;re going to use actually i&amp;#39;m not going to call any witnesses or present any evidence let&amp;#39;s settle or i could beat you the plaintiff has shown a pattern of making derogatory statements about my client hearsay not the emails which have no tone of voice and are subject to interpretation which is exactly why your argument is shaky at best then beat me in court kyle there is a reason that harvey chose me to be his guy do you really want to find out what that reason is and how do i know this isn&amp;#39;t some sort of trick it&amp;#39;s not a trick it&amp;#39;s just our chance to stand out look settling gets us in and out of there in five minutes you drop the suit and you and i spend the rest of the week making ourselves indispensable to the partners while everyone else buries their heads in candy land court i&amp;#39;m going against my better judgment and trusting you so we have a deal daniel the paperwork looks good despite the fact that you two decided to go lawyer commando but the devil&amp;#39;s always in the details harvey i know that impulse purchases don&amp;#39;t exist in your world but the timing was right and as for the details i like to leave that to my man scott does he always like to be late she just got off a plane from london meet ms dana scott welcome hi thank you scottie harvey oh you two know each other we went to harvard law together harvey was fifth in the class and i was oh i forget what was it married to the library that&amp;#39;s right number one number one at studying okay this way tell me scottie what&amp;#39;s my success rate against you in the real world where we practice real law oh harvey there should be no winners or losers in a merger just a happy new couple that&amp;#39;s right and well i say we let these two talk deal points while i try your chef&amp;#39;s famous sea bass absolutely play nice we like each other even if you two don&amp;#39;t married to the library it&amp;#39;s not my fault the library was the best you could do do you have the preliminary proposal no i just flew in from london completely unprepared try not to be intimidated i used some big words overcompensation isn&amp;#39;t that big of a word it isn&amp;#39;t i can hardly wait to see the work of a senior partner i see my promotion popped up on your harvey specter google alert that&amp;#39;s not all that&amp;#39;s going to pop up can&amp;#39;t remember the last time we had a bed pretty convenient that we&amp;#39;re working on a hotel merger remember the mining deal shaft how could i forget listen about the due diligence uh uh uh harvey you know the rules no case negotiations until we&amp;#39;re done i think that might be a while oh couldn&amp;#39;t resist seeing brilliance in action huh actually i have to be here i&amp;#39;m playing the part of the plaintiff wow i knew you were pissed but i didn&amp;#39;t realize you were petty what does that mean it&amp;#39;s an adjective it means small minded spiteful okay you chose to work with the one guy who&amp;#39;s going against me kyle asked me and i said yes you know what it doesn&amp;#39;t really matter because you&amp;#39;re never going to take the stand really how&amp;#39;s that it&amp;#39;s a surprise prepare to watch a mock trial legend be born is counsel ready to proceed with opening statements we&amp;#39;d like to submit a settlement agreement plaintiff is ready your honor which is it counselor um the counsel for the plaintiff and i agreed to a settlement yesterday he must have misunderstood we had discussed but i never agreed to anything do you have a signed agreement uh i no then we are ready to proceed you have the floor thank you on march st sydney thompson was unwittingly recorded on a cell phone she made a joke the type of joke that i&amp;#39;m sure every person in this courtroom has made at one point or another and yet she was fired she was denied severance mr ross mr ross are you ready um the uh the defense uh according to bowmaster v whitely if the party to a settlement is surprised by the repudiation of the settlement then the court must provide a reasonable amount of time to prepare for the trial reasonable time yes your honor you get five minutes vega has more property debeque has more potential which is harder to monetarily define this isn&amp;#39;t the library scottie my guy is an up and comer that&amp;#39;s why your guy is pouncing your client is an impulse shopper which is what may have made him a quick success but could make him an even faster failure so he&amp;#39;s a passionate guy he falls in love with a city and he builds himself a hotel who are you to argue with his track record i&amp;#39;m a realist and i have never seen a deal pushed through so quickly so what so your guy might wake up tomorrow and decide that he doesn&amp;#39;t want to do this which is why i&amp;#39;m not showing you our private books without a signed deal is that a joke am i laughing look i may not have been awake during our m a clinic except for when you were copying my notes which was no walk in the park you write like a monkey but in any case due diligence is a requirement i have an obligation to my client then we don&amp;#39;t have a deal and everyone&amp;#39;s going to know it&amp;#39;s because you killed it you know i don&amp;#39;t see you rushing to show us your private books i have nothing to hide you can have full access to our books right now great you show me yours and i&amp;#39;ll show you mine don&amp;#39;t say it harvey mike hey are you okay now you care mr ross i&amp;#39;m going to have to ask you not to speak to my client she&amp;#39;s not your client she is rachel the paralegal and i only have five minutes so you should really get out of my face what&amp;#39;s your problem mike my problem is that you don&amp;#39;t have the balls to make this a fair fight kyle lawyering isn&amp;#39;t about fighting fair and you better watch your false accusations or i might just sue you for defamation come on the defendant wishes to countersue on what grounds i believe that&amp;#39;s my line counselor defamation of character the plaintiff&amp;#39;s video negatively impacted the perception of lena lunders and impaired her financial well being that&amp;#39;s ridiculous your honor in order for there to be defamation the statements made would have had to have been false that&amp;#39;s not the case here then you should have no problem proving that in court the countersuit is allowed are you serious would you like to approach the bench and find out how serious i am your honor the defense should have filed counterclaims before the trial began yes he should have but no one in this crop of associates had the foresight to do so and we drafted a whole addendum just because we assumed one of you would so i&amp;#39;m going to allow it do you have a problem with that no your honor this is now a defamation trial you have until friday to prepare nice recovery thinking on your feet but you wouldn&amp;#39;t have had to if you hadn&amp;#39;t been so naive thank you your honor how did the negotiation go you come out on top why didn&amp;#39;t you tell me scottie was opposing counsel because i didn&amp;#39;t want you to have performance anxiety about the case she&amp;#39;s tough you&amp;#39;re obvious and your fly is unzipped no it isn&amp;#39;t but it was earlier today you can do better ooh is that what scottie said type up the deal points i got her to cave debeque&amp;#39;s going to run the show all i had to do was show her our books i can&amp;#39;t believe it you gave me like the worst advice anyone&amp;#39;s ever given another person take the drama down a notch juliet i tried to settle and i got completely blind sided i told you to settle i didn&amp;#39;t tell you to be stupid what do you think is going to happen in the real world you have to be prepared for anything well in the real world i won&amp;#39;t have to be looking for someone to play my fake witness in my fake trial wait wait wait wait what do you think you think witnesses are just going to jump up and present themselves because they&amp;#39;re not and sometimes when you have one they disappear or recant and you know what you do you deal with it mock trial is about figuring out what type of lawyer you want to be and there&amp;#39;s only two types winners and losers okay that sounds great harvey but i haven&amp;#39;t prepared i don&amp;#39;t have anyone to play my client or my witness and apparently i&amp;#39;m going up against someone that i can&amp;#39;t trust figure out a way to beat him anyway winners don&amp;#39;t make excuses when the other side plays the game hey donna i proofed that final agreement on the hotel merger quick question has harvey ever heard of spell check oh my god sorry are you no no no it&amp;#39;s okay no no you don&amp;#39;t have to cry it&amp;#39;s okay it&amp;#39;s okay he says things sometimes and they and they cut to the bone he does it to me too i know he says the it&amp;#39;s not bad right i can also do the demi moore single tear left eye or right eye if that&amp;#39;s better for the character okay i&amp;#39;m scared what&amp;#39;s going on if i&amp;#39;m going to play lena lunders for you i need to be able to use my full range of emotions oh my god i love you yeah i know focus you need another witness and at this point everybody else in the firm is booked up aw is mommy helping you clean up your mess ross am i mommy in this scenario what uh ross is just a baby oh my god i cannot believe i&amp;#39;m going to lose to that tool okay come on no pity parties go to an outside source for the other witness for the best friend you need somebody pretty sympathetic and most importantly willing to go above and beyond for you what are you doing here jenny come on i need your help i&amp;#39;ve got nowhere else to go you yelled at me kissed me pushed me away disappeared i haven&amp;#39;t talked to you in forever i don&amp;#39;t even know what&amp;#39;s going on in your life well if you let

you&amp;#39;re maybe not as cool as clark kent still clark kent mmm hmm okay you&amp;#39;re cut off mmm what nothing it just feels really good to tell you i don&amp;#39;t really have anybody i can talk to about it you trust me yeah i guess i do i like that ooh i really like this hmm i&amp;#39;ve got to hand it to you harvey you may not be able to commit to a woman but you have been in this place a very long time she gets me and has no needs i don&amp;#39;t think you understand how high maintenance this place is he agreed to all your terms despite my protests that he could do better so we&amp;#39;re done minus a few signatures that&amp;#39;s not done want me to leave ladies and gentlemen of the jury please note can i ask a question no you can&amp;#39;t ask questions as a witness don&amp;#39;t ask questions ladies and gentlemen yeah i know that but um what are you doing what do you mean you&amp;#39;re walking around like you have a giant stick up your ass it&amp;#39;s a trial jenny i i have to be powerful but that&amp;#39;s not you thanks no you are charming and funny and trustworthy that&amp;#39;s your power and that&amp;#39;s great when i&amp;#39;m trying to con my way into the lsats but this is a courtroom it&amp;#39;s useless there but it&amp;#39;s still you so take a deep breath just talk to me ask me where do i work where do you work lunders global initiative ask me how i know sydney how do you know sydney she was my friend and i&amp;#39;ve missed her every day that she&amp;#39;s been gone and why aren&amp;#39;t you friends anymore i don&amp;#39;t know if you do it like that they&amp;#39;ll fall in love with you scottie that was amazing careful harvey you need to hydrate you just ran a marathon and i think you just beat me uh oh that&amp;#39;s a lawyer look law school post mock trial in the library second circuit court of appeals class action on the prep room table dempsey settlement in my office on the desk and under so what are we doing a highlight reel as a matter of fact we are those were top moments right they weren&amp;#39;t bad no they were great and i just realized this was better you were the best you&amp;#39;ve ever been and i know why why you hid something from me in the negotiation and i want to know what you know what you are ridiculous uh you know what don&amp;#39;t do that okay do what you think i don&amp;#39;t know victory sex when i see it huh see it what is it one of vega&amp;#39;s properties is bankrupt the buenos aires one what uh what do you want me to say harvey you yes you got me i screwed you how oh my god you want an anatomy lesson now that&amp;#39;s my shirt consider it a winner&amp;#39;s reward hey harvey you were right there&amp;#39;s been a steady stream of stock buying by vega&amp;#39;s company in the last hours it&amp;#39;s a hostile takeover yeah but why are they disguising it as a merger they wanted access to our private books she tricked me what she pretended she didn&amp;#39;t want to hand over their books so i wouldn&amp;#39;t notice when she asked for ours it&amp;#39;s a classic maneuver she made me think it was my idea how do you know that because i taught her how to do it so now they see how strong debeque&amp;#39;s company is and they want to buy it and they&amp;#39;ll be running it by the time scottie&amp;#39;s back in london wow i leave you alone for two days this is my mistake this is halley&amp;#39;s comet take a good look because it won&amp;#39;t happen again so what are you going to do i want to know which of debeque&amp;#39;s hotels are the most valuable and how fast we can get them on the market wait you want debeque to sell his best hotels it&amp;#39;s called the crown jewel defense we unload the highest grossing assets and we make ourselves look undesirable debeque will never agree to that trust me debeque has enough passion for his company that he&amp;#39;ll be willing to chop off an arm to save the body okay you know you had that memorized the first time you read it right yeah but i didn&amp;#39;t finish reading it because a certain witness chose to be distracting that must have been rough for you yeah you have no idea where can i get some water i need to make sure my voice holds up right there i&amp;#39;ll make you a deal winner gets the girl you know i&amp;#39;m never going to make another deal with you again hey they remind me of a younger less attractive you and me please don&amp;#39;t say things like that and i know that you rigged the lottery so that mike would get kyle please rigged expedited they&amp;#39;re all just words besides don&amp;#39;t you want to see what your boy is made of you talking bet yeah usual amount i believe we have a wager some of us shower before we go to work mr specter you know what save it right how are you feeling good good yeah good is it inappropriate to take a xanax if you&amp;#39;re a witness in a trial i&amp;#39;ve seen clients do much worse actually i&amp;#39;m not a client i&amp;#39;m a witness in a friend&amp;#39;s mock trial one thing if you get into trouble don&amp;#39;t play the case play the man what are you talking about good lawyers worry about facts great lawyers worry about their opponents kyle is cocky and devious figure out a way to use that against him okay anything else kick his ass who&amp;#39;s your friend uh mike ross do you know him uh yeah uh it&amp;#39;s a big firm but i know who he is yeah god i don&amp;#39;t know why i&amp;#39;m so nervous i just know this is a big deal to him and i don&amp;#39;t want to let him down hmm sydney thompson was at a party and made a joke it wasn&amp;#39;t meant to be mean or to be taken as fact and it most certainly was never meant to be public the defense will show that sydney thompson chose to publicly defame her boss with an impression that she knew would be damaging both to lena lunders&amp;#39; reputation and her company i call lena lunders to the stand uh do you need a minute no i can continue thank you please i&amp;#39;m a self made woman i created the global initiative to target problems in third world countries i take my work very seriously and if a joke can be made of that fine but as a woman in power people look at your success and label you they don&amp;#39;t know the complexity it takes for a woman to succeed in this business and when someone undermines that well we have to fight for ourselves don&amp;#39;t we your honor objection so it&amp;#39;s hard to be a woman in business that has nothing to do with the facts of this case we can only understand the damage your client has done by fully understanding the care with which ms lunders has built her reputation um i&amp;#39;m sorry can you ask me the question one more time take a deep breath it&amp;#39;s just you and me we&amp;#39;re just going to have a conversation about your job okay yeah okay how do you know the defendant sydney thompson we were coworkers we started at the same level and then i was promoted to be her immediate superior and do you know about the video in question yes i was at the party that night and what were you celebrating that night my promotion same night that&amp;#39;s interesting ms ginnesse what did you think of the impersonation it was too far it was mean so why do you think ms thompson did it ms lunders promoted me sydney hated it and that&amp;#39;s why she made the video well thank you ms ginnesse nothing further your honor did sydney ever tell you that she hated your promotion not exactly yes or no please no well then how do you know that she hated your promotion i could just tell can you tell what i&amp;#39;m thinking right now that you&amp;#39;re wishing i would agree with everything you say no i was thinking that if you could actually read my mind i wouldn&amp;#39;t bother asking you questions but you can&amp;#39;t read my mind can you no i&amp;#39;m a managing director not a magician no and i&amp;#39;m pretty sure you can&amp;#39;t read sydney&amp;#39;s either and you actually have no idea why she made that video correct i guess i don&amp;#39;t no good afternoon ms scott thank you are you here to give me a proper send off i don&amp;#39;t think we can do that out here on the street you sure you tricked me i&amp;#39;m impressed to be fair vega did want a merger i just convinced him that given your client&amp;#39;s propensity for rash purchases that allowing him to stay in charge was a bad idea vega needed debeque&amp;#39;s hotels minus debeque and i found a way one that he never asked for or wanted and one that he&amp;#39;s never going to get is is this for real three of debeque&amp;#39;s properties that will be on the market by the end of day he&amp;#39;s never going to let you sell off his crown jewels see that&amp;#39;s the thing about passionate clients when they&amp;#39;re crossed they get angry and they&amp;#39;ll do anything to get back don&amp;#39;t do this harvey look there&amp;#39;s another way we can do this we can get our clients into a room together you can tell them you were wrong and we can convince them back into a merger ms thompson what was the intent behind your impersonation i was just trying to be funny everyone in our office makes jokes as a matter of fact ms lunders encourages us to be informal i can&amp;#39;t win this just on the facts but i expected it i think everyone has the impulse to move up and at a certain point you just have to let it go so that&amp;#39;s what i did what are you going to do i&amp;#39;m going to play the woman not the case you say you expected to be passed over for a promotion correct yes and yet you applied three times yes and you were never promoted as i said yes when nora ginnesse was promoted you wrote scathing emails to the rest of your coworkers in response not scathing the intent was to be funny oh right you like to be funny who doesn&amp;#39;t like to laugh someone whose reputation has been ruined objection just a thought he&amp;#39;s testifying sustained mr ross questions i&amp;#39;m sorry your honor forgive me i was just trying to be funny on your performance review lena lunders wrote good work ethic lacks skills do you think that&amp;#39;s a fair assessment fair i i don&amp;#39;t know your coworkers were promoted and your boss was calling you mediocre are you mediocre no so why haven&amp;#39;t you been promoted i don&amp;#39;t know do you think you deserve better doesn&amp;#39;t everyone so why haven&amp;#39;t you tried i have tried why haven&amp;#39;t you improved i didn&amp;#39;t say i haven&amp;#39;t improved well your review did your five years without a promotion did look you were so angry that you weren&amp;#39;t moving forward that you lashed out at your boss objection testifying no and everyone was moving past you so what people making good on their potential badgering your honor people who can cut it i can cut it excuse me your honor settlement&amp;#39;s still on the table what let&amp;#39;s settle same deal win win no i&amp;#39;m good excuse me i&amp;#39;ve seen the dreamy looks ross you like her so you&amp;#39;re offering me a settlement because you don&amp;#39;t want to hurt her feelings but i&amp;#39;d rather see if you&amp;#39;ll break her giddy up cowboy counselor would you like to proceed no your honor are you sure yes your honor nothing further well normally we&amp;#39;d move on to closing statements but it&amp;#39;s been a long week and honestly we all know where this is going so the court rules in favor of the defendant court is adjourned mr ross naive and soft not qualities we&amp;#39;re looking for at pearson hardman gentlemen i appreciate you leaving the swords at home what started off as a true merger never needed to become anything different daniel i want you to listen to me i know harvey and he just wants to merge your businesses so he can double his billable hours quiet scott i want to hear what he has to say i&amp;#39;m just here to get my client the deal that he wants and what he wants is a merger is that right jones that&amp;#39;s right daniel your law firm overreached in a situation where it wasn&amp;#39;t necessary it&amp;#39;s not entirely scottie&amp;#39;s fault we lawyers all have an instinct to win but sometimes we may not fully understand what that means we understand what it means well maybe you do and maybe you don&amp;#39;t for me it would be to see both men return to the initial deal so that you can grow both your businesses instead of having one company with a hostile reputation and the other a shell of what it once was i mean that doesn&amp;#39;t sound like a win to me i&amp;#39;m sorry let&amp;#39;s just go back to the original deal we can run it together you need anything because otherwise i&amp;#39;m going to head out celebratory drinks with the associates yep and what exactly are you celebrating you know what you can save the disappointment harvey i know what i did do you because what i saw is that you backed off because you were worried about hurting your girlfriend&amp;#39;s feelings it was a fake trial all right i weighed the pros and the cons and i decided it wasn&amp;#39;t worth hurting someone for the result the result is you just told every partner in this firm including myself that you have a weak stomach you don&amp;#39;t have what it takes you know you keep telling me that i have to decide what kind of lawyer i want to be and if i were smart i&amp;#39;d probably be just like you because everybody knows you&amp;#39;re the best but i&amp;#39;m also trying to decide what kind of person i want to be and sometimes i like my kind of person a lot more than yours you want to know what kind of person i am tough but fair i call it like i see it and what i see is a kid who asked for an opportunity and still hasn&amp;#39;t decided if he wants it or not single malt please harvard club i thought you hate this place vega kicked me out of his hotel so you know beggars save the pout you were head of law review you clerked for a supreme court judge and you almost beat me i think that deserves a drink on you i&amp;#39;d laugh but i just got fired from the firm no but the firm is not going to be happy that&amp;#39;s why i&amp;#39;m not already on a plane hey the scottie i know is tougher than that is she whoa you want to go back to our alma mater and see a lecture on why women are better at science might cheer you up maybe but i&amp;#39;m not going with you come on we&amp;#39;re still friends i&amp;#39;m getting married harvey his name is steve and uh he asked me a month ago and um when i get back to london i&amp;#39;m i&amp;#39;m going to say yes what would you like me to say nothing come here i&amp;#39;m sorry i won no harvey i would hate it if you were sorry about that you didn&amp;#39;t have to do that you know i know i could have handled it i know that was a thank you if you couldn&amp;#39;t tell i could tell so um jenny was a great witness really likable and pretty yeah yeah she is i know i was hard on you this week it&amp;#39;s okay rachel no it did you ever take a minute to wonder why i was so mad at you i just expect more from you than most people why you&amp;#39;re a smart guy you can figure it out &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div class=bar style=width:0.4%&gt; &amp;nbsp;

you know if you either of you ever get arrested for anything you call this guy he&#x27;s the best attorney in the city what would we get arrested for um i don&#x27;t know what are you thinking about doing uh as your attorney i would definitely advise you to do that uh four more yeah i must warn you that representing yourself at trial is not the what&#x27;s he doing here you think you can schedule a meeting without me knowing it oh no i&#x27;m privy to all communication between you and the court well if your driving matched your legal knowledge we wouldn&#x27;t be here your honor this case should be dismissed it&#x27;s a matter for insurance insurance only covers repairs it does not deal with my losses what losses because of that accident i missed my chance to get my taxi medallion can&#x27;t you just buy it next year the loan i got expires in one week on top of that a medallion costs  this go round next year   so his entire claim rests upon the assumption that he would have won this year&#x27;s medallion the hallmark of america is that the little guy gets to see justice done we are all equals in the eyes of the law that is why out of all the countries in the world i chose to come here what do you have to say about that counselor i say atticus finch makes a good speech here but this is a fender bender not a multi million dollar law suit vicarious liability applies to discrimination harassment and accidents employers are responsible for their employees&#x27; negligence the court finds a reasonable suit here trial starts tomorrow thank you your honor you&#x27;re getting a good kick out of this aren&#x27;t you i am but i&#x27;m taking this on its merits and you better bring your a game tomorrow because he&#x27;s got a legitimate claim he wants a trial i&#x27;ll give him a goddamn trial your honor so how many cases have you won i only remember how many i&#x27;ve lost none well what happened to the drinks i got a better idea let&#x27;s say we get a bottle and take the party back to your place make it a bottle of dom and you&#x27;re on all right how about four bottles come on you guys want to get a cab definitely definitely cab four bottles of dom you want to spend any more of my money just relax okay it&#x27;s an investment in the evening and uh i just said the thing about the bottles to get the girls out of the bar really because it looked like you were trying to get away from those guys taxi what guys the guys in the back you know what i&#x27;m talking about come on who are they look those two i i i don&#x27;t know where are all the cabs well it looked like they knew you and not in a very good way i i don&#x27;t know maybe they were uh flirting with our dates okay i&#x27;d be pissed too if i watched those legs walk away from me how we doing ladies my feet are killing me in these heels i&#x27;m sorry hey trevor come on taxi seriously stop playing with me what was that about back there look i&#x27;m not playing with you all right but just if you play your cards right maybe you and uh maybe marcella will maybe she&#x27;ll play with you okay now it&#x27;s going to be a tight squeeze who wants to sit on my lap we don&#x27;t go after him no we&#x27;re going to get to him through this guy a ha just like the good old days huh are you kidding me this is way better than the good old days i&#x27;m actually missing a shoe hey where are we uh i think we&#x27;re in hoboken you wanted to see me did you go to see joy after i told you not to how did you know i didn&#x27;t until now i told you a puppy can&#x27;t clean up its own mess mess all i did was tell her about my grandmother your job is to make my life easier if you can&#x27;t understand that why did i hire you police report summarized traffic signal analysis medallion bids attendees and results that&#x27;s why you hired me i thought you were all over the joy situation instead you&#x27;re all over page six you wanted me to do pro bono work this is it pro bono enhances a firm&#x27;s image this makes us look like wealthy bullies against an everyman cabby does that seem like it enhances our image to you i refuse to answer that on the grounds that i don&#x27;t want to someone had a fun night answer another call you shouldn&#x27;t have i i i didn&#x27;t i was piece of advice when the big dog asks the puppy something like that it&#x27;s a rhetorical question got it before you go the phone call the other day when you answered it during the meeting yeah i&#x27;m sorry about that it won&#x27;t happen again who was it um it was just a friend you know an emergency what kind of emergency um was it the friend who almost got you busted for drug trafficking that friend trevor he&#x27;s not dealing anymore harvey so it was him he called you from jail you know i make a living learning how to read people mike so if i saw it jessica did too is that the kind of impression that you want to leave around here this guy is not your friend he is an anchor dragging you down get rid of him he is my oldest friend harvey i wasn&#x27;t just going to let him rot in jail what&#x27;s going to happen the next time because there will be a next time you going to bail him out put yourself in jeopardy you know if it weren&#x27;t for trevor you and i never would have met cut him loose we&#x27;re here to see mike ross he&#x27;s an associate his friend trevor referred us thank you it looked like they knew you and not in a very good way hey excuse me officer is central park that way yeah just go right there i&#x27;m sorry i&#x27;m really terrible with direction is it this street right here this street yes right here yeah okay trevor it&#x27;s mike call me back i need to know what the hell is going on did you get the red velvet cupcakes yes three dozen extra icing how the hell did that happen okay you know what there problem solved i asked you how&#x27;d you get that tear a couple of guys came to the firm they were looking for me i don&#x27;t know what they wanted but i&#x27;m pretty sure it has something to do with some shit trevor did and that big brain of yours doesn&#x27;t remember me saying to cut ties with that loser you know what you&#x27;ve been blowing off joy&#x27;s deal all week for your friend okay so please first of all trevor is not your friend you want to know why i&#x27;m loyal to ray i was taking a limo and i left  in it ray happened to be the driver he found it and tracked me down not a nickel of it was missing and his first reaction when this accident occurred was to ask if we were okay now what would trevor&#x27;s have been cut him off and as far as the licensing deal goes just because you think i&#x27;m blowing something off doesn&#x27;t mean i am now watch and learn everything&#x27;s set for you to walk away we&#x27;re selling your stake as a block your headhunter is lining up your replacement as we speak well harvey this was the most wonderful surprise you&#x27;re a long time client who wants to be with her family it was the least i could do and you&#x27;ll have all the free time in the world to spend with them joey broke the lamp oh that&#x27;s great now how soon can we send them home they&#x27;re booked on the first flight out tomorrow morning so when you had donna text you the girls&#x27; names i was talking about her daughters and you were going to fly them out all along do you remember when i said you don&#x27;t send a puppy to clean up its own mess yes harvey i do i&#x27;m not a puppy court will come to order mr santana your opening statement please driving a cab isn&#x27;t glamorous but it&#x27;s an honest day&#x27;s work ever since i started i&#x27;ve looked forward to a time when i could tell customers that they were riding in my cab that i was an owner operator so i scrimped and i saved until i finally had enough put away to buy a medallion but because of the actions of these men i&#x27;ve lost that opportunity so make no mistake this trial is not about a busted headlight this is a trial about a broken dream forget the case they&#x27;re going to make him president statements are like free throws easy nobody&#x27;s playing defense are we good at defense you would agree that chauffeured drivers cause more accidents objection badgering sustained objection argumentative leading the witness ambiguous privileged inflammatory sustained anything further mr santana yes your honor i would like to call to the stand mr michael ross please what time had you called for the limo on the morning of the accident we were supposed to leave at  and what time did you get to work objection irrelevant it&#x27;s highly relevant your honor it speaks to the psychology of the driver rahim benghazi overruled answer mr santana&#x27;s question  so unless mr benghazi made up for that lost time you were going to be late for that meeting correct yes no further questions your honor when the accident occurred you were on your way to the medallion auction when and where was this auction to take place am city hall according to the police report the accident occurred at am that means you only had seven minutes to get downtown in rush hour traffic objection irrelevant i believe when i made the same objection you told his honor it was highly relevant overruled you were running late only the stakes for you were much higher weren&#x27;t they these things never start on time then why was the first medallion sold at am you were scared your chance at a medallion was going up in smoke and you ran a red then you used the accident to paint me and ray benghazi as a couple of scapegoats you can&#x27;t prove that what color was the light i take the fifth you can&#x27;t take the fifth mr santana this isn&#x27;t a criminal case what color was the light he cut me off you claim to love our legal system so much answer the question what color was the light your honor answer the question mr santana it just meant so much to me your honor can i sidebar with opposing counsel we can roll the dice with the jury but i&#x27;d rather settle how much would i have to pay nothing you take responsibility for the accident and your insurance company makes ray whole in return i waive my right to collect legal fees i don&#x27;t know what to say don&#x27;t say anything i&#x27;ve got a reputation to maintain that goes for you too judge damn it trevor i left you like five messages good to know your boy&#x27;s flaky with everyone i was taking it personal what do you want well trevor owes us   he&#x27;s never paid so you&#x27;re going to bail him out listen i don&#x27;t have that kind of money okay i can&#x27;t well if you&#x27;re not down here in an hour with it we&#x27;re going to take it out on trevor tell him where the money is whatever you do don&#x27;t show up trevor you have one hour hello hello what do you think you&#x27;re doing leaving in the middle of a trial i&#x27;ve got some things to take care of you mean someone to take care of you never cut trevor off did you no i didn&#x27;t my friend&#x27;s in trouble and i&#x27;m going to help him you know what this is what addicts do the second they start making progress they screw up because deep down they think it&#x27;s only a matter of time until they fail they&#x27;d rather fall from the third floor than the penthouse nothing you say can stop me then tell me what the hell is going on he&#x27;s clean no wires you sure yeah i&#x27;m sure remember what happened with the guy he was pounds now who did you say you were again trevor&#x27;s lawyer trevor didn&#x27;t mention a lawyer he doesn&#x27;t know he hired me come on open the briefcase where&#x27;s the goddamn money that photo is a screen shot taken from my firm&#x27;s security video we know what you look like and if mike ross doesn&#x27;t hear from me in the next five minutes he&#x27;s calling the police no man you&#x27;re not coming in here and threatening us you&#x27;re looking at kidnapping extortion and drug dealing and the district attorney happens to be number three on my speed dial well if we&#x27;re looking at all that time you might as well add murder i&#x27;ve got a better idea retainer agreement if you sign right here you&#x27;ll become one of my clients and i won&#x27;t be able to testify against you even if i wanted to what about the money this envelope contains   consider it a down payment on trevor&#x27;s debt only here&#x27;s the thing i don&#x27;t do pro bono work and my retainer agreement requires a down payment of   now as your attorney my job is to give you advice so here&#x27;s the deal sign the agreement i thought i said not to come remember that forty bucks from the fifth grade you owe me if you were dead how would i collect oh man i&#x27;m sorry i just put you in trouble just by hanging out with you so why did you do it because i&#x27;m a dick i bet you didn&#x27;t think you&#x27;d have to save my ass so soon after bailing me out i wasn&#x27;t the one who saved you yeah wow as a friend that guy puts me to shame harvey&#x27;s not my friend trust me well he didn&#x27;t put his ass on the line because of me listen i pled you down to a misdemeanor drunk and disorderly and i paid the fine i think it might be a good idea if you got out of town for a while montana you said you wanted a clean slate i figured hours on a bus ought to do the trick oh yeah it will do me good wait when i get back you know who the first person i&#x27;m going to call is yeah the one person you know who&#x27;ll answer it for you what&#x27;s this i&#x27;m very happy you took ray on pro

we get arrested for um i don&amp;#39;t know what are you thinking about doing uh as your attorney i would definitely advise you to do that uh four more yeah i must warn you that representing yourself at trial is not the what&amp;#39;s he doing here you think you can schedule a meeting without me knowing it oh no i&amp;#39;m privy to all communication between you and the court well if your driving matched your legal knowledge we wouldn&amp;#39;t be here your honor this case should be dismissed it&amp;#39;s a matter for insurance insurance only covers repairs it does not deal with my losses what losses because of that accident i missed my chance to get my taxi medallion can&amp;#39;t you just buy it next year the loan i got expires in one week on top of that a medallion costs this go round next year so his entire claim rests upon the assumption that he would have won this year&amp;#39;s medallion the hallmark of america is that the little guy gets to see justice done we are all equals in the eyes of the law that is why out of all the countries in the world i chose to come here what do you have to say about that counselor i say atticus finch makes a good speech here but this is a fender bender not a multi million dollar law suit vicarious liability applies to discrimination harassment and accidents employers are responsible for their employees&amp;#39; negligence the court finds a reasonable suit here trial starts tomorrow thank you your honor you&amp;#39;re getting a good kick out of this aren&amp;#39;t you i am but i&amp;#39;m taking this on its merits and you better bring your a game tomorrow because he&amp;#39;s got a legitimate claim he wants a trial i&amp;#39;ll give him a goddamn trial your honor so how many cases have you won i only remember how many i&amp;#39;ve lost none well what happened to the drinks i got a better idea let&amp;#39;s say we get a bottle and take the party back to your place make it a bottle of dom and you&amp;#39;re on all right how about four bottles come on you guys want to get a cab definitely definitely cab four bottles of dom you want to spend any more of my money just relax okay it&amp;#39;s an investment in the evening and uh i just said the thing about the bottles to get the girls out of the bar really because it looked like you were trying to get away from those guys taxi what guys the guys in the back you know what i&amp;#39;m talking about come on who are they look those two i i i don&amp;#39;t know where are all the cabs well it looked like they knew you and not in a very good way i i don&amp;#39;t

hired me i thought you were all over the joy situation instead you&amp;#39;re all over page six you wanted me to do pro bono work this is it pro bono enhances a firm&amp;#39;s image this makes us look like wealthy bullies against an everyman cabby does that seem like it enhances our image to you i refuse to answer that on the grounds that i don&amp;#39;t want to someone had a fun night answer another call you shouldn&amp;#39;t have i i i didn&amp;#39;t i was piece of advice when the big dog asks the puppy something like that it&amp;#39;s a rhetorical question got it before you go the phone call the other day when you answered it during the meeting yeah i&amp;#39;m sorry about that it won&amp;#39;t happen again who was it um it was just a friend you know an emergency what kind of emergency um was it the friend who almost got you busted for drug trafficking that friend trevor he&amp;#39;s not dealing anymore harvey so it was him he called you from jail you know i make a living learning how to read people mike so if i saw it jessica did too is that the kind of impression that you want to leave around here this guy is not your friend he is an anchor dragging you down get rid of him he is my oldest friend harvey i wasn&amp;#39;t just going to let him rot in jail what&amp;#39;s going to happen the next time because there will be a next time you going to bail him out put yourself in jeopardy you know if it weren&amp;#39;t for trevor you and i never would have met cut him loose we&amp;#39;re here to see mike ross he&amp;#39;s an associate his friend trevor referred us thank you it looked like they knew you and not in a very good way hey excuse me officer is central park that way yeah just go right there i&amp;#39;m sorry i&amp;#39;m really terrible with direction is it this street right here this street yes right here yeah okay trevor it&amp;#39;s mike call me back i need to know what the hell is going on did you get the red velvet cupcakes yes three dozen extra icing how the hell did that happen okay you know what there problem solved i asked you how&amp;#39;d you get that tear a couple of guys came to the firm they were looking for me i don&amp;#39;t know what they wanted but i&amp;#39;m pretty sure it has something to do with some shit trevor did and that big brain of yours doesn&amp;#39;t remember me saying to cut ties with that loser you know what you&amp;#39;ve been blowing off joy&amp;#39;s deal all week for your friend okay so please first of all trevor is not your friend you want to know why i&amp;#39;m loyal to ray i was taking a limo and i left in it ray happened to be the driver he found it and tracked me down not a nickel of it was missing and his first reaction when this accident occurred was to ask if we were okay now what would trevor&amp;#39;s have been cut him off and as far as the licensing deal goes just because you think i&amp;#39;m blowing something off doesn&amp;#39;t mean i am now watch and learn everything&amp;#39;s set for you to walk away we&amp;#39;re selling your stake as a block your headhunter is lining up your replacement as we speak well harvey this was the most wonderful surprise you&amp;#39;re a long time client who wants to be with her family it was the least i could do and you&amp;#39;ll have all the free time in the world to spend with them joey broke the lamp oh that&amp;#39;s great now how soon can we send them home they&amp;#39;re booked on the first flight out tomorrow morning so when you had donna text you the girls&amp;#39; names i was talking about her daughters and you were going to fly them out all along do you remember when i said you don&amp;#39;t send a puppy to clean up its own mess yes harvey i do i&amp;#39;m not a puppy court will come to order mr santana your opening statement please driving a cab isn&amp;#39;t glamorous but it&amp;#39;s an honest day&amp;#39;s work ever since i started i&amp;#39;ve looked forward to a time when i could tell customers that they were riding in my cab that i was an owner operator so i scrimped and i saved until i finally had enough put away to buy a medallion but because of the actions of these men i&amp;#39;ve lost that opportunity so make no mistake this trial is not about a busted headlight this is a trial about a broken dream forget the case they&amp;#39;re going to make him president statements are like free throws easy nobody&amp;#39;s playing defense are we good at defense you would agree that chauffeured drivers cause more accidents objection badgering sustained objection argumentative leading the witness ambiguous privileged inflammatory sustained anything further mr santana yes your honor i would like to call to the stand mr michael ross please what time had you called for the limo on the morning of the accident we were supposed to leave at and what time did you get to work objection irrelevant it&amp;#39;s highly relevant your honor it speaks to the psychology of the driver rahim benghazi overruled answer mr santana&amp;#39;s question so unless mr benghazi made up for that lost time you were going to be late for that meeting correct yes no further questions your honor when the accident occurred you were on your way to the medallion auction when and where was this auction to take place am city hall according to the police report the accident occurred at am that means you only had seven minutes to get downtown in rush hour traffic objection irrelevant i believe when i made the same objection you told his honor it was highly relevant overruled you were running late only the stakes for you were much higher weren&amp;#39;t they these things never start on time then why was the first medallion sold at am you were scared your chance at a medallion was going up in smoke and you ran a red then you used the accident to paint me and ray benghazi as a couple of scapegoats you can&amp;#39;t prove that what color was the light i take the fifth you can&amp;#39;t take the fifth mr santana this isn&amp;#39;t a criminal case what color was the light he cut me off you claim to love our legal system so much answer the question what color was the light your honor answer the question mr santana it just meant so much to me your honor can i sidebar with opposing counsel we can roll the dice with the jury but i&amp;#39;d rather settle how much would i have to pay nothing you take responsibility for the accident and your insurance company makes ray whole in return i waive my right to collect legal fees i don&amp;#39;t know what to say don&amp;#39;t say anything i&amp;#39;ve got a reputation to maintain that goes for you too judge damn it trevor i left you like five messages good to know your boy&amp;#39;s flaky with everyone i was taking it personal what do you want well trevor owes us he&amp;#39;s never paid so you&amp;#39;re going to bail him out listen i don&amp;#39;t have that kind of money okay i can&amp;#39;t well if you&amp;#39;re not down here in an hour with it we&amp;#39;re going to take it out on trevor tell him where the money is whatever you do don&amp;#39;t show up trevor you have one hour hello hello what do you think you&amp;#39;re doing leaving in the middle of a trial i&amp;#39;ve got some things to take care of you mean someone to take care of you never cut trevor off did you no i didn&amp;#39;t my friend&amp;#39;s in trouble and i&amp;#39;m going to help him you know what this is what addicts do the second they start making progress they screw up because deep down they think it&amp;#39;s only a matter of time until they fail they&amp;#39;d rather fall from the third floor than the penthouse nothing you say can stop me then tell me what the hell is going on he&amp;#39;s clean no wires you sure yeah i&amp;#39;m sure remember what happened with the guy he was pounds now who did you say you were again trevor&amp;#39;s lawyer trevor didn&amp;#39;t mention a lawyer he doesn&amp;#39;t know he hired me come on open the briefcase where&amp;#39;s the goddamn money that photo is a screen shot taken from my firm&amp;#39;s security video we know what you look like and if mike ross doesn&amp;#39;t hear from me in the next five minutes he&amp;#39;s calling the police no man you&amp;#39;re not coming in here and threatening us you&amp;#39;re looking at kidnapping extortion and drug dealing and the district attorney happens to be number three on my speed dial well if we&amp;#39;re looking at all that time you might as well add murder i&amp;#39;ve got a better idea retainer agreement if you sign right here you&amp;#39;ll become one of my clients and i won&amp;#39;t be able to testify against you even if i wanted to what about the money this envelope contains consider it a down payment on trevor&amp;#39;s debt only here&amp;#39;s the thing i don&amp;#39;t do pro bono work and my retainer agreement requires a down payment of now as your attorney my job is to give you advice so here&amp;#39;s the deal sign the agreement i thought i said not to come remember that forty bucks from the fifth grade you owe me if you were dead how would i collect oh man i&amp;#39;m sorry i just put you in trouble just by hanging out with you so why did you do it because i&amp;#39;m a dick i bet you didn&amp;#39;t think you&amp;#39;d have to save my ass so soon after bailing me out i wasn&amp;#39;t the one who saved you yeah wow as a friend that guy puts me to shame harvey&amp;#39;s not my friend trust me well he didn&amp;#39;t put his ass on the line because of me listen i pled you down to a misdemeanor drunk and disorderly and i paid the fine i think it might be a good idea if you got out of town for a while montana you said you wanted a clean slate i figured hours on a bus ought to do the trick oh yeah it will do me good wait when i get back you know who the first person i&amp;#39;m going to call is yeah the one person you know who&amp;#39;ll answer it for you what&amp;#39;s this i&amp;#39;m very happy you took ray on pro bono you on the other hand can afford our services you want me to pay me to represent me mmm hmm ten hours at a an hour yeah i&amp;#39;ll let you do the math you can&amp;#39;t be serious i&amp;#39;ll tell you what i am serious about i hear you&amp;#39;re finally mentoring the kid i don&amp;#39;t know what you&amp;#39;re talking about really because i understand that you dropped the puppy analogy on him which is exactly what i used on you it may have slipped out by accident on accident on purpose the really important thing is that i&amp;#39;m taller than you yeah yep you look much thinner in that you planted that story be man enough to own it i don&amp;#39;t traffic in the tabloids harvey but

just leave everything behind running away isn&#x27;t gonna help it any michelle please more details on that elsewhere today power has still not been restored to many cities on the southern seaboard in the wake of this afternoon&#x27;s widespread blackout while there had been some inclement weather in the region the problem seems linked to what authorities are calling a catastrophic power surge that has crippled traffic in the area no no damn okay okay please please please don&#x27;t hurt me please just let me go okay i won&#x27;t tell anybody i promise okay please just let me go please you need fluids you were in shock what are you going to do to me i&#x27;m going to keep you alive work on getting handy with these my boyfriend was expecting me he&#x27;ll send the cops looking i&#x27;m sorry but no one is looking for you you&#x27;ve got some fight in you i can respect that but don&#x27;t even think about trying that again you&#x27;re lucky to be here at all and my generosity only extends so far eggs toradol to help with your pain please please just let me go please there is nowhere to go michelle i looked through your wallet given as how i saved your life i think that&#x27;s acceptable you&#x27;re lucky to be here at all what do you mean i found you and i saved your life by bringing you here i don&#x27;t understand i there&#x27;s been an attack what an attack a big one i&#x27;m not sure yet if it&#x27;s chemical or nuclear but down here we&#x27;re safe and where are we exactly underneath my farmhouse forty miles outside of lake charles i was driving north of here you were in an accident you were turned over on the side of the road i was driving by and i saw i saved your life michelle i couldn&#x27;t just leave you there okay well thank you so much for saving my life i guess i should go to a hospital now you can&#x27;t leave an attack means fallout which contaminates the air above ground that&#x27;s how it works how long do we have to wait until it&#x27;s safe depends on the proximity of the closest blast one year maybe two and that&#x27;s if we&#x27;re talking about weapons that we know of russians are developing some nasty stuff and if the martians finally figured out a way to get here their weapons will make the russkies&#x27; look like sticks and stones luckily i&#x27;ve prepared for this right well i&#x27;ll need to use your phone then to call my family and tell them that i&#x27;m safe here and make sure they&#x27;re okay michelle they&#x27;re not okay how do you know that everyone outside of here is dead but what about you don&#x27;t you have a family who&#x27;s that excuse me what did you do you know what michelle i&#x27;m gonna tell you what i told him you need to eat you need to sleep and you need to start showing me a little bit of appreciation my name is howard by the way oh god oh shit i&#x27;m sorry i&#x27;m sorry about that uh i didn&#x27;t mean to scare you are you um here you hungry so how are you doing you okay what is this it&#x27;s a bunker your room&#x27;s a little bit of a fixer upper but at least you got a door a scary door but you still got a door how long have you been down here couple of days i think you know it&#x27;s actually kind of hard to tell with no windows or sunlight or anything i mean how do we get out of here oh he didn&#x27;t tell you about getting out of here is the last thing you want to do because the air up there it&#x27;s contaminated i see you&#x27;ve met emmett what happened to him he did that to himself and his stumbling around isn&#x27;t helping anything what you heard earlier was him knocking over a shelf with a whole week&#x27;s worth of food which he&#x27;s sorry for correct totally let&#x27;s go bathroom time this is the common area good for r r as you can see i&#x27;ve planned for a long stay the aquaponics system cleans the air and keeps it fresh this is the living room help yourself to any reading if you like to watch films i have some on dvd and vhs cassette just make sure you put them back in their sleeve when they&#x27;re done the kitchen&#x27;s fully functional has an electric stove refrigerator freezer silverware and that table&#x27;s a family heirloom which means watch your glasses always use coasters and placemats keep your hands to yourself understand no touching take a seat this way this is my private space off limits unless i give express permission go ahead i don&#x27;t need to you will though and i&#x27;ve got to pace these things out so please i need privacy you&#x27;re welcome to close the curtain i can&#x27;t with you standing there and i can&#x27;t trust you not to burn this place down this is for my own safety i&#x27;m not some pervert just go don&#x27;t flush unless you&#x27;ve gone we can&#x27;t afford wasted flushes take a seat are you hungry those are megan&#x27;s she never went anywhere without two or three of those things who&#x27;s megan megan&#x27;s not with us anymore don&#x27;t worry just the generator maybe it&#x27;s a car outside that&#x27;s not possible i heard one earlier above my room if you had heard a car the driver would be long dead by now well shouldn&#x27;t we at least try to call the police or someone to find out what actually happened there&#x27;s no one left to call see that nothing&#x27;s coming through you think i sound crazy i mean it&#x27;s amazing you people you wear helmets when you ride your bikes you have seat belts in your cars you have alarm systems to protect your homes but what do you do when those alarms go off crazy is building your ark after the flood has already come i think maybe it&#x27;s time you met frank and mildred closest i could get to an airlock see what happened to them they weren&#x27;t as lucky as you it&#x27;s the air michelle that&#x27;s what happens when you get exposed i keep this door sealed at all times no one comes in or out met frank and mildred huh it&#x27;s funny right the whole world ends and the thing he&#x27;s most upset about is a pair of dead pigs you in need of some reading material i took all the quizzes sorry but i did learn how to do a french braid so you know if you want me to do that for you just let me know what do you know about him he was in the navy i know that i guess he did uh some stuff with satellites what kind of stuff satellite stuff well what brought him out here i&#x27;m not sure he bought this property a while back but i never paid much attention till he hired me to help him get this place set up the work was entertaining though that&#x27;s for sure you know howard&#x27;s like a black belt in conspiracy theory plus you know how often do you get hired to help build a doomsday bunker so he didn&#x27;t kidnap you no what about your arm weren&#x27;t you trying to escape i was trying to get in i watched howard build this place piece by piece for years he was always talking about you know possible attacks from al qaeda russia south korea you mean north korea is that the crazy one so yeah that one and uh you know poured all his money into this place took to it like his life depended on it which you know that stays with you so he told you all this while you&#x27;re building his bomb shelter and now he says that the air is contaminated and everybody&#x27;s dead yeah i know what you&#x27;re getting at but there&#x27;s more to it howard abducted me he drove me off the road and he dragged me here so whatever he&#x27;s telling you about the air some big attack the purpose of this shelter is a lie no no way the attack i saw it myself what do you mean i was on my way home from work and it looked like a flash bright red like an explosion from way far off it wasn&#x27;t like fireworks naw this was more like something you&#x27;d read about in the bible so what you saw what a flash of light lightning a fire that flared up i&#x27;m not explaining it right this wasn&#x27;t like anything i&#x27;d ever seen and so my first thought was to come here and when i got here howard was closing the door and i could see it right there on his face he knew something was happening something bad and so i fought my way in i heard a car right here above us you heard someone right above us that isn&#x27;t possible the air is what contaminated how do you know that because i told him dinner&#x27;s ready i see you two are getting along hmm how&#x27;s that sauce it&#x27;s fine as cooks go i&#x27;m okay not great but okay megan was a good cook you&#x27;ll learn to love cooking mmm mmm it&#x27;s delicious that&#x27;s the best sauce i&#x27;ve ever tasted are you being funny no i mean considering the alternative which is you know getting burnt up in a chemical attack or nuclear i&#x27;d say being alive and down here would make a fried turd taste pretty good so best damn sauce i ever had that&#x27;s not a bad point and please watch your language at table right you know what i haven&#x27;t been able to get out of my head for some reason ever since i got down here tattoos always wanted one but i never got any &#x27;cause everybody always said no no emmett you&#x27;ll never get a decent job if you do that whatever like that matters now right t ell you what if i had known this was coming i would&#x27;ve gotten like of them i swear man i would look like a circus freak or something i&#x27;d just be covered head to toe tattoos all over my you know everywhere face sure right there across my forehead just my name emmett or you know thug life yolo i don&#x27;t even know what that means but you know i hear people saying it all the time so it must be cool hey what about you howard anything you wish you&#x27;d done in all honesty no no no crazy nights in vegas maybe uh take a pilgrimage to waco everything i wanted to do i did i focused on being prepared and i was and here we are oh my goodness is that monopoly there we go yeah that&#x27;s how we kill the time what would you say howard we&#x27;re gonna be down here what like a year two maybe i bet you if we started a game right now we might even get halfway finished by the time stop talking you don&#x27;t need to make jokes about how long we&#x27;re going to be down here when nobody knows how long that&#x27;s going to be your humor is not funny i don&#x27;t appreciate it while i&#x27;m trying to eat and neither does michelle now please shut up and let us eat in peace hmm emmett would you pass me a napkin thank you i know what you&#x27;re saying i never could finish monopoly that game really does take forever right for me though it was um chutes and ladders uh sorry and trouble you know the thing with the dice and the thing that you pressed what was that called the pop o matic bubble yeah did you ever play that um what was that operation loved operation i&#x27;m telling you man i couldn&#x27;t play that game it terrified me why that noise that thing would make when you hit that edge i mean good lord it was pretty scary could you hand me the salt please ah shoot i&#x27;m sorry i&#x27;m gonna need the pepper also what exactly do you think you&#x27;re doing i&#x27;m asking for pepper like hell you were what was that i don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about howard are you trying to insult me here in the shelter that i built that&#x27;s keeping you alive you don&#x27;t think i see what you just did is that how you thank me for saving your life howard calm down shut up shut up and stay in your seat is it now let me tell you i know what a traitor looks like understand i have shown you nothing but generosity and hospitality i want you to apologize to tell me you&#x27;re going to behave i will you will what i&#x27;ll behave and i&#x27;m so sorry sit ah have to stay hydrated hmm that&#x27;s easy to forget down here what&#x27;s wrong nothing where are my keys michelle michelle stop give me those keys come on no don&#x27;t stop no no don&#x27;t don&#x27;t don&#x27;t open that door there&#x27;s a car there&#x27;s a car i see a car no here here here

your car your accident was my fault when i found out about the incoming attack i got frantic i knew i needed to get back here as soon as possible so i was driving like a maniac i tried to pass you and i&#x27;m the reason you went off the road i mean i know i seem like a sensible guy but at the time i wasn&#x27;t myself it was an accident but it was my fault i was afraid to tell you and i&#x27;m sorry um you should shower even the smallest amount of air that came through the hinges could be toxic these were megan&#x27;s if you want i recognized that woman&#x27;s car her name was leslie i think you knew her she was a neighbor emmett wasn&#x27;t the only one who knew about this place if any others somehow survived they could be coming here too as of friday kindness and generosity are antiquated customs i&#x27;m going to need some stitches what you want me to this is your doing isn&#x27;t it i mean i don&#x27;t think i&#x27;m really qualified i&#x27;ll walk you through it here have a drink what is it technically it&#x27;s vodka ah it&#x27;s safe i distilled it myself i just said i distilled it i didn&#x27;t say anything about it actually tasting good yeah that&#x27;s awful you want it on the rocks little trick i taught myself as a young man stationed on a ship with way too much free time every now and again if the co was working us too hard we&#x27;d freeze and snap the knob off the bathroom door while he was still inside it usually took him an hour or two to get out i&#x27;m good suit yourself cheers ah this is clean all you need to do is stitch you&#x27;re doing fine some stuff i grabbed from your car i didn&#x27;t have time to bring in the booze sadly what is all that i wanted to design clothes no wonder you were so good with the stitches megan wanted to be an artist she was your daughter yes she was smart loved to read the magazines were just for fun she inhaled books anything with paris she liked their movies their culture you know we used to have this little joke every once in a while i&#x27;d ask her what do you want to be when you grow up you know what she&#x27;d say french anyway her mother turned her against me took her off to chicago people are strange creatures you can&#x27;t always convince them that safety is in their own best interest you don&#x27;t know they&#x27;re gone anyway at least i tried to help them hey there was nothing you could&#x27;ve done for that woman even if you let her in she still would&#x27;ve died you asked earlier about regrets yeah i&#x27;ve got some of those welcome to the club i mean i lived my life in a mile radius and that was by design i made sure that happened i was so fast in high school i even managed to outrun my bad grades i was all state track three years in a row caught a full ride to louisiana tech up there in ruston i remember i spent the last two weeks of that summer showing off the bus ticket they sent me to anybody who&#x27;d take a look at it and then came the night before i was supposed to leave and i just got so worried about how bad i was gonna do up there with all those smart kids so i went out of my way to get just piss wasted so bad that i knew there was no chance i was waking up in the morning so i missed the bus and i didn&#x27;t buy a ticket for the next one or the one after that well if you&#x27;d gone you might be dead now yeah lucky me right lucky us a few years ago i was at a hardware store and there was this little girl with her dad and he was in a hurry and she wasn&#x27;t keeping up so he kept yanking on her arm but really hard you know too hard i know that feeling when my dad got that way my brother colin was always there to take the worst of it for me and i thought seeing this little girl i thought maybe i could do that for her but i just kept watching and they&#x27;re about to leave and i&#x27;ve done nothing and she slips and it throws him off balance and he hits her and i wanted so badly to do something to help her but i did what i always do when things get hard i just panicked and ran look we&#x27;re here we&#x27;re alive and that means something it&#x27;s gotta you&#x27;ve got to be kidding me what we&#x27;re missing pieces here look at this poor cat he&#x27;s been deformed he&#x27;s got one eye he&#x27;s about to go snorkeling and everything too what are you doing ooh cornering the market on post apocalyptic fashion huh mmm hmm you need more axes and chain saws for what she has a shotgun yeah but what if up there it&#x27;s like what lumberjacks zombies though even howard doesn&#x27;t think that one&#x27;s plausible but you should hear his theory about mutant space worms what is that howard stay calm we&#x27;re okay what was that quiet that sounds like helicopters could be military but not ours how can you tell fourteen years in the navy what&#x27;s happening up there my guess those flashes that kicked this all off that was phase one take out your opponent&#x27;s population centers with big hits all at once fast and then for round two ground sweeps a satellite log showed an increase in coded traffic recently possibly extraterrestrial signals i bet what we just heard were airborne patrols sent to hunt down the remaining signs of life like us okay oh boy that&#x27;s bad and that&#x27;s worse what&#x27;s up there air filtration system i can&#x27;t something blocking the hatch if we can&#x27;t get it back on we&#x27;re gonna run out of breathable air fast you&#x27;re the only one small enough to reach it reach what the filtration system through there the main duct someone needs to get in there and restart it give me a hand let me go she&#x27;s not gonna know her way around the unit you won&#x27;t fit plus your arm she&#x27;ll be fine now to restart the unit you just swing the handle off then on off then on that should do it and neither of us will be able to go in and help you if you get stuck don&#x27;t get stuck michelle everything okay up there it looks like a dead end that&#x27;s the incline climb up that and you&#x27;re almost there ah this sucks what&#x27;s wrong howard he lied he lied about megan what do you mean i think he did something horrible to her no his family moved to chicago years ago what&#x27;s this is that blood here come with me wait that that&#x27;s not megan what do you mean yeah her name is brittany i remember her she went to high school with my little sister she she went missing two years back it was on the news and everything most people just thought she skipped town there was a message up there it said help it was scratched on the inside of the window and this earring this earring was with it did she ever show back up after she went missing he said to me he said to my face that this was his daughter he said this was megan he took her and he killed her all right let&#x27;s just think maybe we take away his gun tie him up get him to confess to whatever it is he&#x27;s done confess to who the police look like i said we can&#x27;t be the only survivors right the woman she was able to get around right at least a little yeah until she died directly above us making choking noises of all the people to save us now that was a great example of teamwork very well done i feel like some music problem solving always puts me in a musical mood michelle you should go shower just in case sure i think i might have an idea ten better ways to style my bangs no not the article this i think i can only make one but it&#x27;s a start no kidding what are you doing up i didn&#x27;t wake you up yet well i&#x27;m fixing your breakfast one egg over medium hey howard what is this you re watching sixteen candles pretty in pink it was one of megan&#x27;s favorite movies can i help you with something no no i&#x27;m just grabbing some water say um you know i was just thinking not that i&#x27;m trying to tell you how to run this place or anything i&#x27;m just a little curious michelle say how close do you think she got to that air filtration unit you think she touched it yeah i&#x27;m pretty sure she touched it well i know she cleaned up after and everything but i&#x27;m just thinking given that unit filters god knows what through from outside if she tracked anything back in with her it&#x27;d be pretty concentrated and i mean it could be all over the shower and the sink in your bathroom right now anyway it&#x27;s just a thought not bad so far partner if howard finds this he&#x27;s gonna kill us all right so we get the gun away from him all right we tie him up make sure he isn&#x27;t going anywhere and then one of us just goes out and looks for help um first word uh tiny small pygmy um little yep mmm hmm all right uh second word ooh michelle is a a girl a girl a child um a girl no she&#x27;s older see so she is a little princess um no it was woman um little women wow little woman next time try being a little more specific let&#x27;s see here i&#x27;m always watching always um god i go wherever i want uh i mean well i don&#x27;t know i know what you&#x27;re doing i see what you&#x27;re doing um i know what you&#x27;re up to look howard i don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re getting at but i see you when you&#x27;re

count adhemar or wage real war as well i am leader of the free companies my army is in southern france geoff &#x27;tis my lady william you aim too high i don&#x27;t know any other way to aim concentrate what should i say to her what do you think of the joust it&#x27;s very abrupt and i don&#x27;t understand the rules then i shall educate you a match is three lances one point is given for breaking a lance between the waist and neck two points for breaking on the helmet it&#x27;s difficult the helmet sweeps back most blows glance off three points for bearing a rider to the ground also if you bear a rider to the ground you win his horse do men die in the joust lance points are tipped with coronals which blunts them of course accidents happen i myself jocelyn have never been unhorsed nor have i your name lady i still need to hear it sir hunter you persist perhaps angels have no names only beautiful faces and you are i am um have you forgotten or your name is sir &#x27;&#x27; um&#x27;&#x27; ulrich von lichtenstein from gelderland i&#x27;d forget as well what a mouthful your armor sir what about it how stylish of you to wear an antique you&#x27;ll start a new fashion if you win my grandfather will be able to wear his in public again and a shield how quaint some of these poor country knights little better than peasants the second son of sir wallace percival third earl of warwick my lords my ladies it is with honor i introduce my liege sir thomas colville you&#x27;re good you&#x27;re very good my lords my ladies and everybody else here not sitting on a cushion today you find yourselves equals for you are all equally blessed for i have the pride the privilege nay the pleasure of introducing to you a knight sired by knights a knight who can trace his lineage back beyond charlemagne i first met him atop a mountain near jerusalem praying to god asking his forgiveness for the saracen blood spilt by his sword next he amazed me still further in ltaly when he saved a fatherless beauty from the would be ravishings of her dreadful uncle in greece he spent a year in silence just to better understand the sound of a whisper so without further gilding the lily and with no more ado i give to you the seeker of serenity protector of italian virginity the enforcer of our lord god the one the only sir ulrich von lichtenstein thank you thank you i&#x27;ll be here all week that was different it&#x27;s time we celebrated our differences just maybe not in public you yes i&#x27;m well aware a good fonging is on the way oh yeah oh yeah i got their attention you win their hearts very good was she watching geoff what did she see me yes she did did she see me take the hit yes was she concerned her eyes welled up just awful colville has perfect technique i&#x27;ve never seen him before nor i but this lichtenstein his technique rudimentary style nonexistent still he&#x27;s fearless fearless how so the slit in the visor is narrow but splinters can penetrate it most knights raise their chins at the last instant you lose sight of your opponent but protect your eyes ulrich doesn&#x27;t he keeps his eye on the target a true hunter sir ulrich i&#x27;m through but i&#x27;ve never not finished before i wish to keep my honor intact a draw and colville is hurt colville withdraws ulrich advances why didn&#x27;t ulrich finish him he shows mercy then he shows his weakness that&#x27;s all mercy is for the love of victory william go to sleep i can&#x27;t love has given me wings so i must fly i can&#x27;t explain it she makes me feel like a poet you may feel like a poet but you sound like an idiot you don&#x27;t even know her name her name her name is aphrodite calypso venus take your pick women weaken the heart without your heart you cannot win but her eyes concentrate tansy cakes count adhemar sends word he said he will win this tournament for you he&#x27;s won many he wins them for himself and his own honor it&#x27;s nothing to say he wins them for me he wishes to speak to you again not to hear a word i say adhemar wants his women silent would you have sir ulrich win the tournament for you no and he is the only knight who has not promised to do so sir ulrich von lichtenstein i would have him win my heart adhemar adhemar adhemar oh lovely i don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ve ever seen count adhemar lose no but defeat him and you&#x27;ll see it firsthand my liege sir ulrich christiana my lady bids you wear this token of course she also said to tell you her name is jocelyn au revoir au revoir oh jocelyn concentrate i can&#x27;t breathe no style

no i found a new way to heat steel it&#x27;s thinner smaller but just as strong what are these the marks of my trade should another knight admire the armor twist and bend feel the movement but

distanced himself with victories if you win your remaining matches and your opponents take key losses you could make the semis or the finals at least the armor&#x27;s proven itself and your love have you proven that yet wat you remember church as a boy the fear the passion that&#x27;s what she makes me feel and for that i say my rosary to jocelyn and no one else william that&#x27;s blasphemous

true&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;7&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;Babe(1995)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;A2/A2+&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;and how it changed our valley forever there was a time not so long ago when pigs were afforded no respect except by other pigs they lived their whole lives in a cruel and sunless world in those days pigs believed that the sooner they grew large and fat the sooner they&#x27;d be taken into pig paradise haa haa get up a place so wonderful that no pig had ever thought to come back yo yeah good bye mom so when the day came for their parents to go to that other world of endless pleasures it was not a time for young pigs to be sad just another step towards the day when they too would make the journey perhaps it was because he was alone perhaps his sadness made him easier to catch whatever the reason of the thousands of animals in the piggery that day only one was chosen how&#x27;s this one harry just right for the purpose how much do i owe you it&#x27;s a runt harry a worthless little runt you&#x27;re too modest esme hoggett nine out of ten first prizes for jams and jellies is more than a matter of luck luck still plays its part our berries

creature she be i&#x27;ll tell you not fly all them wolves is cruel to sheep always have been brutal savages that&#x27;s what they be i wouldn&#x27;t want to see a gentle soul like you mixin&#x27; with the likes of them that afternoon when he saw fly the pig&#x27;s mind was a tangle of questions cruel vicious brutal what was it that dogs did in the fields all day hello babe had a good day yes thank you the old sheep had to be wrong about fly and the pig promised himself that he would never think badly of any creature ever again crime and punishment the morning of the terrible crime started like any other on hoggett farm comin&#x27; through comin&#x27; through take off now up up up nee nee nee nee hmm i was worried it might have a harsh tone but that&#x27;s quite a nice musical ring i walked into o&#x27;halloran&#x27;s hardware and there it was waiting for me what a splendid way to wake up each morning hoggett dear church when embarking on an audacious crime a duck needs a willing accomplice a creature who is reliable beyond suspicion and above all extremely gullible hey psst wha what you look like an intelligent sophisticated discerning young fella who me yeah follow me oh boy are you in for some fun what are we doin&#x27; where are we goin&#x27; now the duck knew exactly what he had to do the alarm clock had to go his very life depended on it do you see it yes good so i go through the kitchen across the living room good good into the bedroom get the mechanical rooster and bring it out to you what about that cat but quietly bring it out to you excellent i don&#x27;t think i can do it it&#x27;s against the rules only dogs and cats allowed in the house it&#x27;s a good rule but this is bigger than rules this is life and death it is mm hmm follow me hello look there&#x27;s something you should know humans eat ducks i beg your pardon most ducks prefer to forget it but the fact is that humans like to eat plump ducks i don&#x27;t think so not the boss not the boss&#x27;s wife come on humans don&#x27;t eat cats why well they&#x27;re they&#x27;re indispensable they catch mice humans don&#x27;t eat roosters why they make eggs with the hens and wake up everyone in the morning i tried it with the hens it didn&#x27;t work so i turned to crowing and lo i discover my gift but no sooner do i become indispensable than they bring in a machine to do the job ah the treachery of it a mechanical rooster oh dear me oh dear you i suppose the life of an anorexic duck doesn&#x27;t amount to much in the broad scheme of things but pig i&#x27;m all i&#x27;ve got why do you need me to do it i&#x27;m allergic to cats oh they make me sneeze ahh don&#x27;t worry i won&#x27;t wake the cat my life is in your hands oh dear oh no ah boy no no no your foot your foot

up a little but no today proves that it doesn&#x27;t work from now on we&#x27;ll all respect the rules to each creature its own destiny every animal in its proper place and a pig&#x27;s proper place is under the old cart not in the barn and absolutely never in the house is that understood yes sir now pig regarding the company you keep being young it&#x27;s hard to discriminate so i&#x27;ll make it easy for you i forbid you to talk to or consort with that duck ever have i made myself clear uh what&#x27;s consort it means young man that you must not go anywhere near that duck as for the fugitive duck when he shows himself being a duck he must behave like a duck no more of this crowing and nonsense he should accept what he is and be thankful for it that goes for all of us here here rex continued long into the night elsewhere there was more talk the subject was christmas dinner and whether that year the main course would be roast pork or duck a l&#x27;orange and pork is a nice sweet meat then there&#x27;s the crackling that always adds interest and texture get him get the pig get the pig get the pig get him get him psst ferdinand everyone&#x27;s been looking for you shh shh

i was just trying to be a sheepdog hah enough wolves in the world already without a nice lad like you turnin&#x27; nasty you haven&#x27;t got it in ya young&#x27;un you and i are descended from the great sheepdogs we carry the bloodline of the ancient bahou we stand for something and today i watched in shame as all that was betrayed rex he&#x27;s just a little pig all the greater the insult i&#x27;m sorry i bit you are you all right i wouldn&#x27;t call that a bite myself you got teeth in that floppy mouth or just gums you see ladies a heart of gold ahh heart of gold no need for all this wolf nonsense young&#x27;un all a nice little pig like you need do is ask thanks very much it was very kind of you a pleasure what a nice little pig all right how did you do it i asked them and they did it i asked them nicely we don&#x27;t ask sheep dear we tell them what to do i did mom they were really friendly maybe rex might be a little more friendly if i had a talk with him no no no you better leave that to me rex i know it was hard for you today watching all that happening but surely it&#x27;s not worth all this misery please dear not on such a beautiful night you put these ideas into his head two faced traitorous wret get down down rex fly a dark cloud had descended on the valley and the pig felt that the troubles were all his fault but he was certain that he knew how to put things right again oh uh e excuse me sir but i i i think all this trouble well it&#x27;s not distemper can&#x27;t be rabies must be the hormones what about hoggett&#x27;s notion the dog jealous of the wee pig i don&#x27;t see that myself no so what should we do you can keep him locked up or snip snip i can do it tuesday no or wednesday hoggett doesn&#x27;t want the dog operated on he&#x27;s a breeding dog i can sedate him of course but he&#x27;ll be useless as a working dog i&#x27;ll give you pills to put in his food good dog the sheep pig a pig doing the work of a sheepdog with rex out of action and fly injured from the fight farmer hoggett had no choice maa maa the boss has to give you some medicine oh dear i thought so it&#x27;s horrible stuff that i know but it&#x27;s for the best young&#x27;un if you say so shoo shoo when the thought first came to him farmer hoggett dismissed it as mere whimsy but like most of his harebrained ideas it wouldn&#x27;t go away what are they doing it&#x27;s a sheepdog trial so it&#x27;s like a competition for sheepdogs and their bosses it&#x27;s like an obstacle course how do they decide who wins it&#x27;s time and mistakes you get points for how quick you are and they take points off for every mistake every time a sheep goes the wrong way that&#x27;s a mistake and you lose points looks like fun for a sheepdog there&#x27;s no prouder moment rex and i used to hmm never mind oh was rex a champion he had the makings of the greatest champion there ever was but it wasn&#x27;t to be what happened a while back when rex was in his prime the winter rains brought a great flood to the valley rex and the boss got most of the flock onto the high ground then rex went back to look for the strays he found them they&#x27;d been stranded by the rising water he tried to herd them across to safety but they wouldn&#x27;t budge too afraid and too stupid to save their own skins it was freezing cold and the water kept rising rex stayed with them right through the night by morning the sheep were drowned and when they found rex he was barely alive oh mom two weeks rest in front of the fire saw him back on his feet but his hearing was never the same again he&#x27;d never want anyone to know but he&#x27;s almost totally deaf is that why he&#x27;s so you know angry that&#x27;s not the half of it all this was barely a month before the grand national challenge he tried his best but he couldn&#x27;t hear the boss&#x27;s calls and it slowed him up the cold truth is that but for the stupidity of sheep rex would&#x27;ve been the champion of champions good dog that&#x27;s it all right good here we go all right now through here like this and then big hook to the left big hook big hook through this gate here it was at that time that mrs hoggett began to worry about her husband but farmer hoggett knew that little ideas that tickled and nagged and refused to go away should never be ignored for in them lie the seeds of destiny close the gate like that and you&#x27;re done a tragic day mom mom can we start work early today oh dear it&#x27;s not even dawn yet you can go to work when the rooster crows oh go back to sleep ahem um excuse me hello sir excuse me but it&#x27;s nearly dawn and what sorry to disturb you it&#x27;s nearly dawn and i wondered if you&#x27;d mind crowing just a few minutes early this morning get out of here but well see i get lost oh okay whoa now the pig understood why the sheep called all dogs wolves and he was filled with a deep and terrible rage maa maa are you all right hello young&#x27;un oh maa can you get up i don&#x27;t reckon it&#x27;s over maa the wolves have gone far away i&#x27;ll get the boss up here to look after you you&#x27;ll be all right you&#x27;ll be all right oh maa maa maa maa maa maa home pig fly knew that there was only one fate for any creature that took the life of a sheep on hoggett farm but fly could never believe that babe was a sheep killer so she remained in the field to do something she&#x27;d never talk to the sheep tell me who killed the old one wolf wolf is that the only words you half wits know wolf are you saying it was a dog where&#x27;s babe was it wolf or babe wolf babe farmer hoggett was carrying something in the crook of one arm a kind of black shiny tube come pig the pig had a vague memory that shiny tubes produced food and guessed that some quite unexpected surprise would come out of two small round mouths babe wolf babe wolf quiet fly decided to speak very slowly for it was a cold fact of nature that sheep were stupid and no one would ever persuade her otherwise please please would you be so kind as to tell me what happened quiet please tell me what happened this morning the sheep spoke very slowly for it was a cold fact of nature that wolves were ignorant and nothing would convince them otherwise babe came he saved us the wolves killed maa but babe drove the wolves away thank you thank you thank you all very much pleasure talkin&#x27; to ya hooey hoggett hooey arthur oh there you are well what do you think that was the police on the telephone said there are wild dogs about apparently the mitchells lost six lambs this morning what are you doing with that gun oh i nothing pig of destiny it&#x27;s all very simple half an hour at degrees i&#x27;ve given you rabbit casserole for friday now for duchess it&#x27;s liver in the morning heart for the evening except fridays when it&#x27;s steak in the morning and cooked liver at night warm it up a bit but test it because she bites into it before she knows what&#x27;s what that&#x27;ll be the bus oh bye bye have a good time bye hello everyone oh dearie me valda i know i have to be at the national conference i am the assistant general secretary of the northeast region after all but i do worry about leaving that man alone still acting a bit strange just silly things odd little things only a wife would notice still he can&#x27;t get up to too much mischief in three days of course not go on go on oh good evening shame about the weather nasty cough it had been a long time since arthur hoggett had had an animal in whose abilities he had so much faith and with the national grand challenge sheepdog trials only two days away he wasn&#x27;t going to let the fact that his animal was a pig deter him he had been worried for he was a truthful man that the heading might say name of dog and then whatever he put would be a lie but as it happened luck for the moment was running with him it&#x27;s all right really i&#x27;m just well bless you whoa whoa uh easy whoa ah oh no so ah what&#x27;s happening oh no shh easy easy good pig good pig huh huh hold still hold still huh there are many perfectly nice cats in the world but every barrel has its bad apples and it is well to heed the old adage beware the bad cat bearing a grudge how are you feeling a bit tired you&#x27;ll need a good sleep to put you in top condition tomorrow don&#x27;t stay up too late good night good night mom oh do forgive me for scratching you dear i got a bit carried away it&#x27;s a cat thing oh well but oh feeling good about tomorrow are you mm hmm it should be all right i think i probably shouldn&#x27;t say this but i&#x27;m not sure if you realize how much the other animals are laughing at you for this sheepdog business why would they do that well they say that you&#x27;ve forgotten that you&#x27;re a pig isn&#x27;t that silly they even say that you don&#x27;t know what pigs are for what do you mean you know why pigs are here why are any of us here well the cow&#x27;s here to be milked the dogs are here to help the boss&#x27;s husband with the sheep and i&#x27;m here to be beautiful and affectionate to the boss yes the fact is that pigs don&#x27;t have a purpose just like ducks don&#x27;t have a purpose i don&#x27;t all right for you own sake i&#x27;ll be blunt why do the bosses keep ducks to eat them so why do the bosses keep a pig the fact is that animals that don&#x27;t seem to have a purpose really do have a purpose the bosses have to eat it&#x27;s probably the most noble purpose of all when you come to think about it they eat pigs pork they call it or bacon they only call them pigs when they&#x27;re alive but uh i&#x27;m a sheep pig the boss&#x27;s husband&#x27;s just playing a little game with you believe me sooner or later every pig gets eaten

frustrating to be sitting up here wondering what&#x27;s causing the delay we have someone on their way to the judges&#x27; rooms now we&#x27;ll tell you what&#x27;s causing the problem as soon as we find out perhaps it&#x27;s a drug test yeah it could be i&#x27;ve never heard of a drug test at a sheepdog contest before we&#x27;ve got somethin&#x27; here that might be of use to our pig password password before we gives you anythin&#x27; you&#x27;ll be makin&#x27; us a solemn promise yes treat us civil yes you gotta treat us nice like i&#x27;ll try no bitin&#x27; that&#x27;s right wolf must

there&#x27;s no rule we&#x27;ll see about that when the adjudication committee have finished their meeting what will we have next year a laughing hyena doing show jumping but the most important of all you must promise never ever to let this password we be about to give to be used against any sheep anywhere i promise you that i&#x27;ll make sure the pig knows it too we have the promise &#x27;tis for babe maa would have wanted it baa ram ewe baa ram ewe to your breed your fleece your clan be true sheep be true baa ram ewe is that it is that the password mr hoggett the judges would like me to convey to you their disappointment that a man such as yourself with a long and honorable association with the work of national sheepdog association should see fit to flout the historic conventions which have long ruled our sport however we find there is no rule as such which would prevent your animal being entered the committee has ruled that if you wish to proceed there is nothing we can do to stop you what do you wish to do there appears to be some movement down there now i expect if there are no further problems we shall see hoggett and his dog pig unusual name strange name isn&#x27;t it pig anyone for a game of cards oh good grief look he&#x27;s a fool entry number mr a hoggett with pig this is just too crazy to believe and if that isn&#x27;t enough we have a stray dog on the field

clan be true sheep be true baa ram ewe what what did you say get yourself a dog hoggett there there esme it&#x27;s not the end of the world is he just going to stand there until his time runs out or

perfect score yippee yippee and though every single human in the stands or in the commentary boxes was at a complete loss for words the man who in his life had uttered fewer words than any of them knew exactly what to say that&#x27;ll do pig that&#x27;ll do and a one and a two and a three hit it&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;8&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;Back_to_the_future(1985)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;A2/A2+&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;so right now statler toyota is making the best deals of the

wait doc doc the bruise on your head i know how that happened you told me the whole story you were standing on your toilet and you were hanging a clock and you fell and you hit your head on the sink that&#x27;s when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor which is what makes time travel possible there&#x27;s something wrong with the starter so i hid it here after i fell off my toilet i drew this the flux capacitor it works it works i finally invent something that works you bet your ass it works somehow we&#x27;ve got to sneak this back to my laboratory we&#x27;ve got to get you home okay doc this is it never mind that never mind that now why that&#x27;s me look at me i&#x27;m an old man good evening i&#x27;m dr emmett brown i&#x27;m standing on the parking lot at twin pines mall thank god i&#x27;ve still got my hair what&#x27;s on earth is this thing i&#x27;m wearing this is a radiation suit radiation suit of course &#x27;cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars this is truly amazing a portable television studio no wonder your president has to be an actor he&#x27;s gotta look good on television whoa this is it this is the part coming up doc no no no this sucker&#x27;s electrical but i need a nuclear reaction to generate the gigawatts what did i just say this sucker&#x27;s electrical but i need a nuclear reaction to generate the gigawatts gigawatts gigawatts great scott what the hell is a gigawatt how could i have been so careless gigawatts tom how am i going to generate that kind of power it can&#x27;t be done can it doc look all we need is a little plutonium i&#x27;m sure that in plutonium is available in every corner drugstore but in it&#x27;s a little hard to come by marty i&#x27;m sorry but i&#x27;m afraid you&#x27;re stuck here whoa whoa doc stuck here i can&#x27;t be stuck here i got a life in i got a girl is she pretty doc she&#x27;s beautiful she&#x27;s crazy about me look at this look what she wrote here doc i mean that says it all doc you&#x27;re my only hope marty i&#x27;m sorry but the only power source capable of generating gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning what did you say a bolt of lightning unfortunately you never know when or where it&#x27;s ever going to strike we do now this is it this is the answer it says here that a bolt of lightning is going to strike the clock tower at precisely pm next saturday night if we could somehow harness this lightning channel it into the flux capacitor it just might work next saturday night we&#x27;re sending you back to the future okay all right saturday&#x27;s good saturday&#x27;s good i can spend a week in i can hang out you can show me around marty that is completely out of the question you must not leave this house you must not see anybody or talk to anybody anything you do can have serious repercussions on future events do you understand yeah sure okay marty have you interacted with anybody else today besides me yeah well i might&#x27;ve sort of bumped into my parents great scott let me see that photograph again of your brother just as i thought this proves my theory look at your brother his head&#x27;s gone it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s been erased erased from existence whoa they really cleaned this place up looks brand new now remember according to my theory you interfered with your parents&#x27; first meeting if they don&#x27;t meet they won&#x27;t fall in love they won&#x27;t get married and they won&#x27;t have kids that&#x27;s why your older brother&#x27;s disappearing from that photograph your sister will follow and unless you repair the damage you&#x27;ll be next sounds pretty heavy weight has nothing to do with it which one&#x27;s your pop that&#x27;s him okay okay you guys very funny you guys are being real mature maybe you were adopted okay real mature guys okay pick up my books mcfly that&#x27;s strickland jesus didn&#x27;t that guy ever have hair shape up man you&#x27;re a slacker do you want to be a slacker for the rest of your life no what did your mother ever see in that kid i don&#x27;t know doc i guess she felt sorry for him &#x27;cause her dad hit him with the car hit me with the car that&#x27;s the florence nightingale effect it happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients go to it kid hey george buddy i have been looking all over for you you remember me the guy who saved your life the other day oh yeah good there&#x27;s somebody i&#x27;d like you to meet lorraine calvin i&#x27;d like you to meet my good friend george mcfly hi it&#x27;s really a pleasure to meet you how&#x27;s your head good fine oh i&#x27;ve been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night are you okay yeah i&#x27;m sorry i have to go come on isn&#x27;t he a dreamboat doc she didn&#x27;t even look at him this is more serious than i thought apparently your mother is amorously infatuated with you instead of your father whoa wait a minute doc are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me precisely whoa this is heavy there&#x27;s that word again heavy why are things so heavy in the future is there a problem with the earth&#x27;s gravitational pull what the only way we&#x27;re going to get those two to successfully mate is if they&#x27;re alone together so you&#x27;ve got to get your father and mother to interact in some sort of social what you mean like a date right what kind of date i don&#x27;t know what do kids do in the &#x27; s they&#x27;re your parents you must know them what are their common interests what do they like to do together nothing look there&#x27;s a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up of course the enchantment under the sea dance they&#x27;re supposed to go to this that&#x27;s where they kiss for the first time all right kid you stick to your father like glue and make sure he takes her to that dance george buddy remember that girl i introduced you to lorraine what are you writing uh stories science fiction stories about visitors coming down to earth from other planets get out of town i didn&#x27;t know you did anything creative let me read some oh no no no no i never let anybody read my stories why not well what if they didn&#x27;t like them what if they told me i was no good i guess that would be pretty hard for somebody to understand no no not hard at all so anyway george about lorraine she really likes you she told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the enchantment under the sea dance really oh yeah all you got to do is go over there and ask her what right here right now in the cafeteria what if she said no i don&#x27;t know if i could take that kind of a rejection besides i think she&#x27;d rather go with somebody else who biff don&#x27;t kid around come on

this video unit listen doc you know there&#x27;s something i haven&#x27;t told you about the night we made that tape please marty don&#x27;t tell me no man should know too much about his own destiny you don&#x27;t understand i do understand if i know too much about my own future i can endanger my own existence just as you&#x27;ve endangered yours you&#x27;re right now let me show you my plan for sending you home please excuse the crudity of this model i didn&#x27;t have time to build it to scale or paint it it&#x27;s good thank you thank you okay now we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clock tower down suspending it over the street between these two lamp posts meanwhile we&#x27;ve outfitted the time vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux capacitor at the calculated moment you start off from down the street driving directly toward the cable accelerating to miles per hour according to the flyer at precisely pm this saturday night lightning will strike the clock tower electrifying the cable just as the connecting hook makes contact thereby sending gigawatts into the flux capacitor and sending you back to all right now watch this you wind up the car and release it i&#x27;ll simulate the lightning ready set release you&#x27;re instilling me with a lot of confidence doc don&#x27;t worry i&#x27;ll take care of the lightning you take care of your pop by the way what happened today did he ask her out i think so what did she say it&#x27;s your mom she&#x27;s tracked you down quick let&#x27;s cover the time machine hi cal marty mom lorraine how did you know i was here i followed you oh this is my doc my uncle doc brown hi hi marty this may seem a little forward but i was kind of wondering if you&#x27;d ask me to the enchantment under the sea dance on saturday wow you mean you mean nobody&#x27;s asked you no not yet what about george george mcfly he&#x27;s kind of cute and all but not well i think a man should be strong so he can stand up for himself and protect the woman he loves don&#x27;t you yeah i still don&#x27;t understand how am i supposed to go to the dance with her if she&#x27;s already going to the dance with you well because george she wants to go with you she just doesn&#x27;t know it yet that&#x27;s why we got to show her that you george mcfly are a fighter you&#x27;re somebody who&#x27;s gonna stand up for yourself somebody who&#x27;s gonna protect her yeah but i&#x27;ve never picked a fight in my entire life look you&#x27;re not going to be picking a fight dad daddy o you&#x27;re coming to her rescue right okay let&#x27;s go over the plan again where are you going to be i&#x27;m going to be at the dance right and where am i going to be you&#x27;re gonna be in the car with her right okay so right around she&#x27;s going to get very angry with me why is she going to get angry with you well because george nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them you mean you&#x27;re going to go touch her on her no no george look it&#x27;s just an act right okay so you&#x27;re strolling through the parking lot you see us struggling in the car you walk up you open the door and you say your line george oh hey you get your damn hands off her you really think i ought to swear yes definitely god damn it george swear okay so now you come up you punch me in the stomach i&#x27;m out for the count right and you and lorraine live happily ever after you make it sound so easy i just i wish i wasn&#x27;t so scared george there&#x27;s nothing to be scared of all it

world trade center i walk home i live above it actually my ankle bracelet tells the government where i am every second of the day any time of the day but it&#x27;s gonna come off when i go to prison i think i mean i don&#x27;t think i&#x27;m wearing this in prison so that&#x27;s what the plan is for that closing numbers on the markets today at one point the market fell as if down a well it was an historic day with wall street shaken to its very foundation and even the health of the most trusted firms are now being called into question we have former secretaries of treasury who go from government to wall street pocketing hundreds of millions of dollars in i became somewhat obsessed with the role that money itself played in the crisis and the role that governments and banks played in money and why was it that our money was controlled by central banks if something new happens is the government likely to give it a nod or at least ignore it for a while or is the government likely to come down and try to crush it because they&#x27;re afraid of anything new and different this is a monetary revolution bitcoin is the honest currency okay this past week we&#x27;ve been talking about money i&#x27;m gonna ask everybody what you think money is can you give me some answers now money is like paper and you can like buy stuff with it so you have to have like four quarters for a dollar you need money to buy your house like food water oxygen not oxygen money is basically just an accounting system it is a way of recording who owns what who has what who owes what to whom that is all money really is and you needed somebody who could stand as the central issuer somebody who was the trusted third party someone who could guarantee that the money was real and for hundreds of years now we have had governments issue money again money is just an accounting system that&#x27;s what bitcoin is bitcoin is really just an accounting system it is a way of recording transactions recording value and it does it digitally so you and i can send it to each other directly and everything is recorded in the open ledger by monitoring and updating that ledger in a collective consensus based system you do away with the need for somebody in the middle having to be that sort of repository of all the information and that&#x27;s what gets away from the fees the inefficiencies and ultimately the potential for corruption and risk that come with centralizing information in that way what it does is it takes that trusted third party function and it automates it it puts it into an open ledger that is put online that is there for anybody to see so that every bitcoin is accounted for so that you know that you&#x27;re not getting a counterfeit bitcoin it&#x27;s kind of remarkable that this idea of bitcoin was launched just a few weeks after lehman brothers went bankrupt and the whole system nearly collapsed and the problems that cropped up in the crisis were very much a part of the writings of satoshi nakamoto i think what the crisis showed is that the existing system had some major flaws it wasn&#x27;t working and people were hungry for some sort of alternative i discovered bitcoin&#x27;s power when i understood for the first time that it was not controlled by a central company or a central person because i knew that meant it couldn&#x27;t be shut down and if it can&#x27;t get shut down all it needs is to do something useful and it will become more and more adopted and as the value grows people will find more and more uses for it the beauty of bitcoin is it&#x27;s easily transferrable it&#x27;s anonymous and by there&#x27;s gonna be million and that&#x27;s the cap there&#x27;s only x amount of gold there&#x27;s only x amount of bitcoin before if you wanted to send something of value across the internet you had to get somebody else involved you had to have a credit card company or paypal or maybe a bank involved in the transaction the promise of bitcoin is that you&#x27;re directly sending this currency to another person and then the bitcoin network performs the function that normally paypal or a bank or your credit card company would perform bitcoin really puts the control back in the hands of everybody everybody who&#x27;s participating in the bitcoin system is controlling how it works if you want to look for the genesis of cryptocurrency it was the cypherpunk movement you know growing out of a kind of a love of the internet and its possibilities the discovering of cryptography and imagining that you could give birth to a new world really out of the internet a world that lives outside of the nation state and outside the structures of power and the hierarchies that are associated with that these people had talked about the need and the possibility for a digital currency that was anonymous or could be anonymized using cryptography the cypherpunks that emerged in the early &#x27; s were hyper concerned about privacy about personal liberty and a lot of people had come up with their own systems some of them came very close to happening the one that probably came the closest was digicash from david chaum privacy of payments is actually essential for democracy the reason is not because you need to be able to make private payments in order to express yourself but rather that in order to inform yourself you may need to purchase information and that&#x27;s the thing that allows you to have opinions worth expressing although i wouldn&#x27;t say david chaum was a cypherpunk he definitely inspired the cypherpunk movement it&#x27;s as if the cypherpunks kind of came upon david chaum&#x27;s tools like the technology of some alien species and they only took the weapons they were most interested in the ones that could be used to disempower the government and empower individuals the break between him and the cypherpunks came when he realized he would need existing institutions to help him with it so he started talking to governments he started talking to banks he was very close to having this thing happen in the late &#x27; s and nobody was really prepared for this outside of the cypherpunk movement people it seemed like had almost sort of given up on the project other than a few experiments here and there by hal finney nick szabo the conversation around this really died down and then all of a sudden it came back to life after the financial crisis and you had people going back to those experiments in the s and looking at new ways of putting those ideas together nick szabo in had just finished up a mid life stint at law school and if you look nick&#x27;s writing around the financial crisis that is really revived his interest in these ideas that you know he had been working on in the s with privacy and contracts and the problems of governments and other trusted third parties and he brought bit gold back into the conversation so hal finney came up with his own system adam back has hashcash wei dai has b money szabo has bit gold so what satoshi did in was satoshi took a lot of these ideas and made them work he created an encryption based protocol it&#x27;s not really a currency utilizing a ledger called the blockchain allowing for many kinds of transactions to occur contracts all kinds of things can be built into the blockchain and it does this through a system of consensus building where multiple computers all participate in the management of the blockchain ledger a kind of digital document if you will that keeps track of all the payments i understand it&#x27;s something that is instantaneous online and it can go from one country to the other and you know they can have their money well i never heard of it until nancy called me and mentioned digital currency and i&#x27;m thinking she must have been in the bottle this morning or something digital currency oh what what you know but they say it&#x27;s for people who don&#x27;t have bank accounts i can&#x27;t understand if you have one coin it&#x27;s let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s worth what do you do give the number or something to the say the grocery store person and then they subtract it how do you know how do you make change how do you know what you have left or what you&#x27;ve spent you can have the money supply controlled by a computer that&#x27;s all bitcoin really is the key point here is that this a distributed ledger there is no central server all the other ledgers that we have all the banking ledgers all company ledgers they all sit and reside inside that company which means they have one point of attack they can be hacked jp morgan was hacked by you know the cyberthieves not so long ago home depot target we&#x27;ve had all these companies get hacked precisely because there&#x27;s one central repository of information the bitcoin ledger resides on you know thousands of computers you can&#x27;t hack that every single transaction is recorded and once it is recorded in the blockchain it is there it is permanent it cannot be altered it cannot be changed so that you can read it now the identities of the people are encrypted the wallets are encrypted so you don&#x27;t know who is spending the money but you know that every single bitcoin out there has a history you know where it&#x27;s been you know the different addresses it&#x27;s gone between the most important pieces of the bitcoin infrastructure are the miners these are the computers that are tasked with maintaining the ledger of the blockchain to verify the information to update it to make sure that it is trustworthy so how do we incentivize them to do so as they are going through the process of confirming transactions they are simultaneously being subjected to a very very difficult computing test the bitcoin core protocol is forcing them to look for a number all of these miners are ultimately competing to be the one that receives that payout every ten minutes but really that&#x27;s the secondary component they&#x27;re really being rewarded with bitcoin but what is the more important task is the validation and verification of transactions and the maintaining of the ledger bitcoin in being the first to achieve this holy grail of decentralized value exchange that transfers that process of trust to a collective agreement around a body of independent computers who are compelled by an incentive system to maintain that consensus and affirm the information to be correct is incredibly liberating because it means that we can do it without all these intermediaries in all these different realms the most important thing behind bitcoin is not the currency the key factor is the blockchain nobody expected this you know in very few people cared about it it was just the computer scientists and the sort of code geeks that were really interested all of my communication with satoshi was ever via either the bitcoin talk forums which all of that communication is public or private forum messages or private emails satoshi was always all business it was just always about the code my very message to satoshi i asked him so is satoshi your real name what have you done before can you tell me a little bit about yourself and he just ignored that completely but came back and said you know great to have more experienced programmers helping out with the project you know here&#x27;s a couple of problems that need to be solved maybe you can help solve them in i was into bitcoin sort of just as a hobby i didn&#x27;t really know what to do in it yet i was trying to meet everyone i could figure out what projects would be cool to work on i met roger ver sort of in august of that year and a few months later he recommended to this guy charlie shrem who started bitinstant that the charlie should hire me as the head of marketing for bitinstant bitcoin is cash with wings it&#x27;s the ability to be able to take a local transaction and do it globally and that&#x27;s why bitcoin is gonna overturn the financial infrastructure bitcoin is like the largest socioeconomic experiment the world has ever seen our conversations would range from you know the mundane and practical like how the hell are we gonna get another bank account since our current bank account&#x27;s probably gonna get shut down any day now to very high minded aspirational ones like is this actually gonna change the world in a good way are we just a bunch of crazy people who don&#x27;t know what the hell we&#x27;re talking about or are we actually starting to initiate an industry which in hindsight will look obvious to everyone but you know right now does not charlie shrem was at that stage a fairly high profile figure in the bitcoin community the vice chairman of the bitcoin foundation and you know one of these bitcoin millionaires who&#x27;d made a lot of money very quickly and really played an important role in the infrastructure of managing the movement of funds around the system in that early rudimentary phase bid offer in the new york cash market for bitcoin buyers right now will pay cash on the spot who&#x27;s next for the bitcoin you want to know what bitcoin is you know what i prefer i prefer dollars if you want to go on down to broad right next door to the stock exchange there to the new york bitcoin center you can buy and sell all the time you have a table in the middle yeah just one small table round and i have flowers like a flower arrangement a very nice flower arrangement bitcoin flowers bitcoin flowers bitcoin flowers would be white lily purple and orange just right here three colors we&#x27;re putting together the first bitcoin center here in new york city right next door to the new york stock exchange bitcoin is a new space and many of the rules and regulations haven&#x27;t been imposed yet but we will open one day soon after the lawyers do their job a live digital currency exchange what&#x27;s happening here is a fusion between wall street and bitcoin hopefully satoshi seemed to acknowledge that it would be hard for bitcoin to develop in any way in which it wasn&#x27;t interacting with the regular economy of dollars and euros the problem with exchanges is that they took you back to this old world that bitcoin was really trying to get away from as soon as you move back to an exchange you&#x27;re moving back to a world in which some third party has all this personal data on you has all of your money has all of the security vulnerabilities and really has none of those strengths that bitcoin was designed to provide jed mccaleb created mt gox essentially on a lark one night because he couldn&#x27;t buy bitcoins as quickly as he wanted to and interestingly he did it by starting with a url that he&#x27;d previously used to run magic card trading sites so you get an idea about where somebody&#x27;s ideas are coming from and how really kind of rudimentary some of them were jed essentially threw this site together and put it online without too much thought jed essentially sold it to the first person he found who was mark karpeles a french guy who was living in tokyo he really knew very little about mark when he decided to sell it to him and once he took it over it began growing much more quickly than mark was expecting or was prepared for there are million bitcoins programmed into the system that are going to be released it&#x27;s a set number but within that every single bitcoin can be divided up into a hundred million different pieces so there&#x27;s room for it to expand as the use expands especially in the emerging markets in the developing world that is really the most interesting place to see where this thing goes so in my pocket i have a hundred trillion zimbabwe dollars from the reserve bank of zimbabwe just as a reminder of what happens if our governments screw up our money you know zimbabwe&#x27;s a good example of a government that lost the trust of their people and they lost the trust of their people by printing too much money and causing runaway hyperinflation so i think you will see people in other parts of the world who&#x27;ve experienced hyperinflation who&#x27;ve experienced bank failures i think those will be the kind of people who are looking for something something new right they&#x27;re willing to take the risk a lot of us take the capacity to send money to others receive money store money and do it electronically these days for granted because we are amongst the lucky or so of the world that have bank accounts but billion adults in the world do not have access to bank accounts a technology like bitcoin cryptocurrency has the capacity to bring those people into the financial system to give them this power to effectively have what you could argue is a bank in their cell phone a bank in their pocket really could open up commerce to a lot of people who are currently excluded from it somebody who is maybe working in one country and you know they want to send money back home and right now like western union is a big way that people do remittances from a western union perspective we serve clients in many different locations around the globe and primarily for remittances western union serves typically an unbanked customer a customer who is either a migrant worker or an individual who doesn&#x27;t feel comfortable in the financial services sector and the problem with remittances is they&#x27;re really expensive so if i&#x27;m sending back home i may end up spending or just on fees to get that money back to my family that&#x27;s a huge percentage if you&#x27;re poor and working so since bitcoin doesn&#x27;t care about borders i could just send bitcoin to another country and if my family in that other country has some way of spending that bitcoin or has some way of trans of exchanging that bitcoin into the local currency then it&#x27;s just quicker and cheaper and more convenient and a lot of people think that remittances will be one of the really big first uses for bitcoin the one challenge there is we deal with you know at our company transactions peak a second and those happen instantly if you look at a blockchain you have to wait for verifications and if you do a recent test it takes about minutes for every transaction to be validated by the network that doesn&#x27;t scale so it has its challenges as well wikileaks which solicits and publishes secrets and suppressed material from whistleblowers around the world has been under cyber attack from governments that want to shut it down paypal is the latest business to break ties with wikileaks but the whistle blowing website dedicated to publishing classified government documents still continues to seek funding while crossing out paypal as one method of payment in order to insure our future survival wikileaks is now forced to temporarily suspend all publishing operations in order to direct all our resources into fighting the blockade and raising funds the wikileaks scandal seemed to provide an opportunity for bitcoin at the time the big banks and credit cards stopped processing payments for wikileaks and some people thought that bitcoin would provide a way to send donations to wikileaks you could certainly see in the hubbub around wikileaks that satoshi was still somebody who was very paranoid about the government and the government coming in and taking too close a look at the bitcoin project and you could also see that satoshi i think realized at this point that bitcoin was still young software and the kinks hadn&#x27;t been worked out yet in i think late he asked me if it&#x27;d be okay if he put my email address on the bitcoinorg home page &#x27;cause he had been the primary contact for people and i said sure he went ahead and changed the web page but what he did is he left his name there but he took away his email address and so it was just me and my email address who was suddenly getting all of the attention i think that was satoshi&#x27;s way of kind of saying you&#x27;re the leader of the project now there was one particular email where he told me that he was gonna step away from the project and do something else he never told me what else he&#x27;s gonna do or that he is doing i had just been invited to give a talk at the cia and i told satoshi that i accepted the invitation to go speak at the cia after he sent that email to satoshi telling him that he was planning on going to the cia he never heard from satoshi again and that was essentially the last time anybody heard from satoshi you very quickly get caught up in the question of who is satoshi nakamoto where did this come from who is this person i mean this is the s information is out there everything everyone knows everything about everybody how can there possibly be a person that nobody knows who this guy is but there is a person at least i think it&#x27;s a person it might be a group who nobody knows who this guy is and he kind of appears out of nowhere in on these cryptography email lists with this system called bitcoin he&#x27;s very active in the early years there&#x27;s a lot of back and forth with him communicating with people it seemed like most people kind of wrote him off as kind of like a delusions of grandeur kind of scheme hal finney on the other hand seemed to be really interested right from the beginning he was a crypto idealist like he was not as kind of cynical as many of the other cypherpunks so he got really into this he started talking to satoshi nakamoto who he said seemed like some young japanese american coder hal finney was the first guy to work with nakamoto he was a cryptographer soon as nakamoto released it he was one of the first people to email him back and say hey this is interesting i&#x27;d like to work with you and in the first weeks of bitcoin he worked with him back and forth setting up the system and satoshi nakamoto ended up sending hal finney the first ever bitcoin transaction any discussion of satoshi&#x27;s identity has to go back to the fact that bitcoin was based on this small number of projects back in the s that only a handful of people knew about like hashcash and bit gold and b money and so you end up with a pretty small group of people who would have known about these projects people though chaum david chaum was you know everybody in the cypherpunk movement at one point or another they&#x27;ve said well he must have been satoshi they&#x27;ve all come out and denied it probably somebody who started out in the &#x27; s in california with the cypherpunks somebody who was very very good at cryptography who understands encryption and has done a wonderful job of just separating bitcoin from anything that can identify him i think for bitcoin&#x27;s sake that continuing anonymity of satoshi has ended up being a really good thing because people who have gotten involved in it have been able to write their own ideas and dreams onto this technology and there was nobody there to say no that&#x27;s not what i meant in the early early days the first group was really just a bunch of more or less tech minded coders then you had the libertarians come on board who saw it through a political lens i&#x27;m excited to be a little bit of a part of it with allowing and accepting bitcoin and then you had these two groups working together and they overlapped too and the timing was very good because the existing system was in utter disrepair it was like a match to a pile of wood with gasoline poured on top of it and the whole thing kind of really goes viral and takes off and then you have the suits the vc money and it was very small at first just a couple of guys out in silicon valley who ran into bitcoin guys at coffee houses and you started having this meshing of conversations once silicon valley gets on board that whole dynamic starts to take off so now you have the tech minded coders the libertarians the counter culture people the vc silicon valley and you have this entire great mishmash of people coming together you had a network effect the more people that got involved the stronger the network got and the more it grew and it really started growing on itself and in especially you literally see this thing mushroom the thing was just growing growing and growing and growing as more and more people got involved i think most bitcoin companies at the time knew that a big part of the market for bitcoins was people buying drugs on silk road who needed bitcoins to do that the big bang moment for bitcoin was the silk road what ross ulbricht did by creating the silk road was he took this by no means common but usable cryptocurrency called bitcoin and he married it with a streamlined workable user interface that was a free market that could sell anything what would happen if people were really free truly free to trade what they wanted to ross did have an extremely radical libertarian viewpoint and really wanted to experiment with using technology to create free markets for people what ross ulbricht did is a combination of tor and bitcoin that was the aha moment that ross must have had the silk road was basically the fruition of all the cypherpunk dreams the crypto anarchists&#x27; utopia that they had imagined in the &#x27; s you know was real now this was a perfectly in theory anonymous website with perfectly in theory anonymous money used to by any contrabands imaginable the silk road website is a particular headache for authorities it&#x27;s a anonymous online marketplace where people sell drugs that are posted to customers all over the world cyber investigators you know when there&#x27;s a crime can kind of trace you back because you have an ip address it&#x27;s like a telephone number so if you call another computer that ip address is tracked on tor that&#x27;s taken away because your information hops from computer to computer to computer so there&#x27;s no way to trace you back to your original one tor is an anonymous system so if you use the tor browser which it has a browser you can go to tor and download their browser you can browse with some degree of security so that&#x27;s great for plugging your banking information into a site so you don&#x27;t get hacked the other component of tor which has similar uses is called tor hidden services tor hidden services is actually to put it simply a url that doesn&#x27;t have com on the end of it it has onion and that is its own little space where you can create websites and you could freely transact without oversight or regulation people put websites on there that are outside of law enforcement&#x27;s view there&#x27;s hackers for hire there&#x27;s malware there&#x27;s credit card dump services there&#x27;s a whole bunch of them chris tarbell has ended up being in some ways the most important fbi digital crime investigator of the last few years he was the one who took down anonymous essentially so we decided to start looking at some of the services on tor and silk road being one them other cases they would hit tor and they would kind of throw their hands in the air and say it&#x27;s tor there&#x27;s not much we can do about it i found it interesting to kind of take a look at it and tackle it bitinstant was basically born because if you wanted to move your dollars into a bitcoin exchange it takes at least three days and since the major exchange mt gox was in tokyo it could take a week or more so that&#x27;s really problematic and basically charlie figured out that if you just held a balance of dollars at the exchange you could go to him and say charlie i&#x27;ll give you will you give me of credit at the exchange and you can literally then have your dollars at the exchange in ten seconds as opposed to a week so that&#x27;s hugely helpful especially when bitcoin is so volatile and you need to know exactly what price you&#x27;re going to get charlie was raising capital right as sort of i joined during that process he came across lots of interested investors who were starting to get a whiff that maybe this bitcoin thing was cool we had an interesting debate early on about do we invest in bitcoin or bitcoin companies and we sort of decided to do both more towards investing in actually bitcoin in the asset early days but also trying to place a few bets in the ecosystem to support the companies support the entrepreneurs and see how that went a few days after they first found out about bitcoin they were in the bitinstant offices in new york meeting with erik and charlie and erik and charlie essentially talked them through bitcoin and answered all of their questions and concerns what made you invest in bitinstant there are a lot of companies and exchanges and websites with respect to bitcoin regulation is obviously a big question what you do want is a company that sort of takes that seriously and understands that there&#x27;s the technology element there&#x27;s building the company and then there&#x27;s also creating the company that works with regulators and so that&#x27;s bitinstant it&#x27;s not this sort of completely underground thing yeah charlie the ceo happens to have been in this space for a long time so he&#x27;s sort of on the pulse and the cutting edge you know you come out and you say like we want this bitcoin thing to overturn everything but at the same time we have to be compliant and you have to know your customer you have to know every single customer no matter what even if they&#x27;re transferring a dollar or and how reasonable is that the term money laundering was invented by banks and knowing your customer shouldn&#x27;t be this complicated expensive thing and you shouldn&#x27;t treat everyone like a criminal in the beginning they really wanted us involved people were really friendly because it benefits you to onboard more people in so bitcoin&#x27;s always been this very friendly community and it&#x27;s also in some ways it&#x27;s self serving that way but we were there for the right reasons at the time bitinstant was the big company other than mt gox it was the way that most americans were able to buy bitcoins here it is so bitinstant was located right there i think it&#x27;s the one that now says bling it was a whirlwind six months going from total obscurity with no money to becoming one of the hot startups of bitcoin but almost as soon as the twins made their investment in the company it began falling apart the twins had a much more practical approach to bitcoin and bitinstant they wanted to see the company making money and making as much money as it could as quickly as it could they saw early on that it would be regulated that it wasn&#x27;t gonna be this big and have no one be interested in regulating it so they feared that all kinds of regulators would come in at all different angles and tie the thing up in a complete morass where nothing would ever get done so they wanted to help drive the regulation so that whatever regulation would be there would work and would not end up being a complete dead end for bitcoin that strategy is smarter from purely a business perspective but i&#x27;m not in this purely from a business perspective i am in this for business and because i&#x27;m trying to change the world and make it better and building bitcoin companies and begging for regulation that matches exactly the banking regulation that has caused so many problems i feel like is counterproductive for the most part bitinstant was actually taking steps to make sure that people weren&#x27;t using the service for illegal purposes but charlie made the mistake in dealing with btcking of acknowledging that he knew what btcking was doing and that he was acquiring bitcoins to sell them to silk road customers in this case charlie worked with the guy and wrote emails that essentially acknowledged he knew what this guy was up to that stunning arrest of the drug kingpin who goes by the name dread pirate roberts and appears to have cornered the internet drug market his real name is ross ulbricht and his website silk road is packed with products like cocaine and heroin the payment system is all through bitcoins which is basically digital currency not backed up by any international banks not backed up by any us banks but simply based on the confidence of the users who exchange these bitcoins computer to computer there&#x27;s a reason why the case was tried in new york in the southern district and largely that was because of bitcoin ross was caught in san francisco the silk road servers were out of the country so why was ross&#x27;s case tried in the southern district of new york where most of the financial regulations cases are dealt with where the district attorney preet bharara has been all over bitcoin where charles schumer the senator has been all over bitcoin ross ulbricht&#x27;s case is a bitcoin case there&#x27;s absolutely no denying it the level of threat that the silk road posed to the marketplace to wall street whether it&#x27;s a perceived threat or an actual threat was humongous and the idea that somebody could create a marketplace where you could freely transact without oversight or regulation had to be dealt a massive and public blow bitcoin kind of monetized that anonymous part of the internet and made it possible to trade in things that the federal government doesn&#x27;t want you to trade in law enforcement moves slowly but it&#x27;s a big heavy wheel that grinds finely so you know someone was running a hidden service and now they&#x27;re in prison for life they were playing hardball it was very evident that their intention as the judge herself said in her sentencing was to make an example out of ross was to say to all of you people using bitcoin to all of you people who want to tangle with unregulated marketplaces and technologies and open source cryptocurrencies we will throw the book in its entirety at you if you do this we seized a whole bunch of bitcoins and in order to sell those bitcoins off or go to an exchange you have to fit within federal law and state law there&#x27;s not really an exchange that could handle that that met those regulations at the current time so it had to be handled through auction you know anything about bitcoins there&#x27;s an article in the wall street journal today on bitcoins really right here if you want to read it it is digital currency did you see that woman wow oh digital currencies will disrupt global finance transform the way we pay for things and just maybe make the world a fairer place from what i&#x27;ve read on the computer they have had some problems yeah yeah the reason is because you can&#x27;t track it well i think i don&#x27;t like this idea at all when we saw the silk road shut down a lot of people said bitcoin&#x27;s nothing but illegal drugs on the internet that&#x27;s what it is and they would point at the silk road and say look here at all the stuff that&#x27;s happening here and i think when you saw the silk road shut down and bitcoin transaction volume take a tiny little dip and then keep going up you know i think that was a great event to point at and say it really wasn&#x27;t about that it really isn&#x27;t about that it&#x27;s a tiny little part of the economy i guess in the last week i&#x27;ve really started hearing about bitcoin recently i heard a scenario after the fbi had seized a bunch of bitcoins due to illegal transactions now they&#x27;re gonna be auctioning them off like they would a private yacht for you know from some drug dealer so that in a way legitimizes the use of it as a currency looks like it&#x27;s the first live bitcoin exchange on wall street looks that way yeah so one for buying or selling selling on a thousand right now we were looking at the open interest at the floor of the bitcoin exchange there&#x27;s different exchanges that are online that will present at the bidding house but there&#x27;s no true open outcry exchange buyers and sellers coming together in an open clear transparent honest way gox is the highest one why don&#x27;t we call it there&#x27;s my transaction probably the first two transactions of the day it&#x27;s really not about the money it&#x27;s about being involved and i think there&#x27;s a lot more people gonna follow me charlie shrem years old arrested today and charged with engaging in money laundering shrem enabled people to transfer money from bitcoin to cash via his company called bitinstant now the other point that the dea is making is that shrem bought drugs online at silk road and that he knew silk road was a trafficking website and we know the winklevoss twins who obviously were featured in the movie about facebook they&#x27;re actually investors in shrem&#x27;s company yeah you know a lot of people are very excited by this idea they like the idea that you can have a currency that is not tied to any kind of central bank but at the same time i mean think about it if you&#x27;re in the federal government you don&#x27;t like the idea that people could effectively use another form of cash to buy things that they shouldn&#x27;t be buying online with me it wasn&#x27;t all my customers it was one customer out of about customers this was one customer one single and i made that case in my sentencing i said your honor this was one customer it happened that i was literally coming home from amsterdam i was in my sweatshirt i was still stoned i didn&#x27;t know what was going on charlie did not know when to shut up and that ended up getting him in trouble and probably led to the end of his company but they got me under the patriot act and it&#x27;s money laundering because i knew that the money i was taking was eventually possibly going to be used for drug trafficking now drug trafficking is not buying drugs it&#x27;s selling drugs i didn&#x27;t help the drug seller i helped the guy buy drugs but i never went to trial because and i pled guilty because who wins at trial you know like this guy silk road he&#x27;s gonna go to life in trial all he needed to get was a lady whose son died from a cocaine overdose and i would&#x27;ve the jury would&#x27;ve convicted me right there so essentially charlie was selling bitcoins to a guy who was selling bitcoins to people who were putting drugs into their own bodies and for this charlie was charged with crimes that could&#x27;ve put him in jail for years that&#x27;s what the prosecutors were shooting for we have banks that have atms on every street corner in america and those banks know very well that that cash is getting used for drugs and yet that&#x27;s fine they&#x27;re allowed to do that no one gets in trouble but charlie sells bitcoin to a guy who sells bitcoin to someone who uses drugs and he goes to jail he was an entrepreneur that started building this industry built services that people found useful when bankers almost destroyed the world economy and none of them got in trouble whatsoever and here we have this year old kid he goes to jail because he started building an alternative over the last six months our agency has been conducting an extensive inquiry into virtual currency the information we&#x27;re going to gather in this fact finding effort will allow us to put forward during the course of a proposed regulatory framework for virtual currency firms operating in new york yesterday we had serious criminal conduct come to light involving virtual currency as a vehicle for money laundering drug trafficking and other major felonies right now the regulation of virtual currency industry is still akin to a virtual wild west that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re evaluating whether our agency should issue a so called bitlicense specifically tailored to virtual currencies i think people who imagine a very powerful utility like bitcoin that would somehow escape regulation entirely are either naive or extreme optimists bitcoin is a battle of ideas and it forces the issue of whether people should be as free in their handling of money as they are in their handling of speech or religion or relationships with each other if you want to have this thing go mainstream you&#x27;re going to have to have the regulators the lawmakers weigh in on it one of the first ones who really took an interest was benjamin lawsky very important regulator in the financial world and in january holds these public hearings because he wants to come up with a license for bitcoin companies we believe that putting in place appropriate regulatory safeguards for virtual currencies will ultimately be beneficial to the long term strength of the industry itself lawsky was essentially given the opportunity to write the rules for this whole new industry from scratch the first question is the obvious one that&#x27;s on everyone&#x27;s mind sort of unexpected yesterday but with the arrests we saw obviously that&#x27;s put a bit of a cloud hanging over the industry right now and so how do each of you react to what we saw yesterday what it means for bitcoin or virtual currency and its future i think it further supports that bad guys are gonna do bad things and they&#x27;re gonna use whatever technology is available to them but i view it as if the allegations are true and they&#x27;re convicted the system works are people still doing bad things with bitcoin sure is the majority of the bitcoin activity vice not a chance so i think the issue you raise is one that people like to write about the media likes to write about it makes great headlines you get a lot of clicks you can sell a lot of ads but i think it&#x27;s in the rearview mirror there are some people in the bitcoin community from the libertarian side of things that want government to just leave it alone would you say regulation is both inevitable but more importantly actually ultimately going to be crucial for the survival of virtual currency sounds like a terrible idea to me just understand what we&#x27;re trying to do with bitcoin we&#x27;re trying to create a world where transactions can move globally for free okay and making these companies hire you know some outsourced compliance firm is a bad idea it&#x27;d be great in any industry if you could just open the door and let folks run out and give it a shot we may choose not to invest in a company if they can&#x27;t get licensed by you if the choice ultimately is between preventing money laundering on the one hand and i probably shouldn&#x27;t even use the word money laundering &#x27;cause it&#x27;s too nice a word frankly money laundering is the facilitation of all kinds of horrific crimes that i think everyone in this room never wants to see happen acts of terrorism funding rogue nations etc all take place through massive money laundering now the choice for the regulator is permit money laundering on the one hand or permit innovation on the other we&#x27;re always going to choose squelching the money laundering first i agree that i don&#x27;t think anybody wants money laundering when we got a first saw bitcoin you know about a year and a half almost two years ago i don&#x27;t think anybody would deny that it was a bit of a wild wild west because there was no regulation there was no framework to evaluate the asset evaluate companies determine who was compliant and who was not and a wild west attracts cowboys and i don&#x27;t think anybody here would disagree with the fact that a sheriff would be a good thing a lot of i think the entrepreneurs feel like they have to self censor they don&#x27;t want to come out vocally critical of the regulations part of that is maybe &#x27;cause some of them just like regulations but i think another part of it some of them just feel like they will get attention of the regulators if they come out against them yes we want them to innovate but at the same time we just can&#x27;t live in a world where we&#x27;re gonna permit money laundering to go on i think regulators should give bitcoin some time to grow up too much regulation now will just stifle innovation i think before regulators kind of come in and say we&#x27;re gonna solve all your problems and then fail to solve all their problems i think they should give the innovators time to solve those problems one function of regulation is to make things clearer so right now bitcoin because it&#x27;s so new is in a state of flux everywhere the lesson from the internet is anything that china bans invest in and that&#x27;s a joke but the us allows google to operate here allows twitter to operate here allows bitcoin to operate here allows facebook to operate here chinese government doesn&#x27;t allow any of those companies to operate the way they operate in this country or at all this is about freedom ultimately you know we&#x27;re yards from the old world trade center here and i think all of us never want to see anything like that happen again and it would have been a lot harder for to ever have occurred had we had the protections in place that would prevent the movement of massive amounts of money around the globe by people who would want to kill everybody in this room so i think the key is to not create useless regulation but i think the motives behind a lot of those rules are to ensure we don&#x27;t miss something again since there&#x27;s this absurd obsession with terrorism so any time a regulary gets up and says well bitcoin can be used for terrorism well of course it can so can anything so can cell phones and so can the internet and so can the car it doesn&#x27;t mean that we should stifle the growth of those industries just because bad people can use it this has arguably been the worst week in the cryptocurrency&#x27;s short life stunned by the collapse of once dominant exchange mt gox now that failed firm&#x27;s ceo mark karpeles is in hiding some bitcoins allegedly stolen or lost which accounts for about of the total circulation by the time mt gox went down it was holding what its customers believed were about a half a billion dollars worth of their bitcoins and the company&#x27;s bitcoins it was no longer the largest exchange in the world but part of what&#x27;s so amazing is that people kept using it even after there had been numerous incidents in which it was clear that the company was not up to the task of safeguarding the money and the only reason he survived as long as he did was because in the price started going up people kept putting money into it he had more and more money &#x27;cause the price was going up but as soon as the price started going down this is what happened right it peaks in late it starts coming down in soon as that price started coming down it all just tumbled for him gox was going to collapse that it lasted as long as it did was actually kind of a stroke of fate but its failure was it didn&#x27;t have the kind of more boring mainstream institutional controls that we require to bring it to the next level and there&#x27;s a whole bunch of money missing and no one knows if they just lost it it if was stolen from them if they embezzled it or what but the important lesson from gox isn&#x27;t that bitcoin doesn&#x27;t work the important lesson from gox is that you don&#x27;t leave your money with a trusted third party because you can&#x27;t always trust them you can only trust them until you can&#x27;t this was also a lesson that people were supposed to learn during the financial crisis but they don&#x27;t seem to have learned it yet mark karpeles was a gamer he was not a finance pro he really didn&#x27;t know what he was doing and he didn&#x27;t build it jed mccaleb built it he didn&#x27;t improve upon it i mean it lurched from crisis to crisis throughout the entire history last year was a terrible year for bitcoin and an especially terrible year for the foundation because we had two of the people on our board of directors who had to resign in disgrace basically you know my expertise is technology my expertise is not figuring out like who&#x27;s trustworthy who&#x27;s not which businesses are gonna succeed which businesses are gonna fail after we had held our hearings we thought we would take six months to nine months even a year to draft our initial regulations this was so complicated that we wanted to really take our time and get it right what happened was though mt gox collapsed and i think that gave us a real renewed sense of urgency and we realized that if we got regulation right we could create more confidence in bitcoin frankly as opposed to the sort of loss of confidence you saw not only from the silk road case but also from the collapse of mt gox so your sense though of the regulators right now i assume you&#x27;ve had conversations the discussions that we&#x27;ve had i think everybody recognizes the innovation and doesn&#x27;t want to stifle it they just want to make sure that there&#x27;s healthy regulation so it&#x27;s used in a safe and productive manner i&#x27;m not giving up on new york new york&#x27;s giving up on me i can&#x27;t even turn on the bitcoin machine an atm i can&#x27;t turn it on i can&#x27;t make trades i can&#x27;t do anything there&#x27;s no cash flow at all and it&#x27;s potential regulation it&#x27;s regulations i should believe is coming down the pipe like i don&#x27;t want to do anything that someone&#x27;s frowning upon right next door to the stock market they&#x27;re gonna lock me up you know you can&#x27;t have an exchange well we don&#x27;t people meet there and exchange with each other new york&#x27;s sitting there on the high horse and the whole world&#x27;s waiting on new york to create some fuckin&#x27; license ultimately lawsky&#x27;s office brought out the final rules for the bitlicense in the spring of a lot of companies complained that the regulations were too burdensome for them to operate in new york and still make money i saw just overnight dozens of companies that were on the verge of launching they just threw in the towel and said we can&#x27;t afford this erik voorhees&#x27; new company shapeshift would have had to apply for the bitlicense if it wanted to keep customers in new york so in my lap here i have the the application forms for license to engage in virtual currency business activity which is a very statist way of saying the bitlicense the is the application to be approved to do basically what we&#x27;ve all been doing for years now which is building bitcoin companies in new york and a lot of stuff in here i personally feel is unethical so we&#x27;re not gonna comply with it which means we have to block new yorkers entirely and when an entire new industry starts blocking a place like new york that used to be the financial center of the world hopefully some of those politicians will take notice the point of it is to one make sure there are enough consumer protections two make sure we have adequate cybersecurity three make sure that the companies are adequately capitalized so they don&#x27;t collapse upon themselves you know you&#x27;ve seen a tug of war between the hard liners and those who are saying you know you&#x27;ve got to have enough space for innovation in here and the system has come out i think probably stronger as a result of that and there&#x27;s a widespread view amongst certainly the business bitcoin community that some level of regulation gives legitimacy to what they&#x27;re doing it gives people confidence in what they&#x27;re doing this is an important part of growing up ultimately they&#x27;re not going to get it right because no regulation is ever right but i&#x27;m highly confident that whatever happens going forward the bitlicense will be looked at as a positive development in the evolution of bitcoin because it just removed one of the biggest pieces of uncertainty which is how is this industry going to be regulated i think most of us at least a lot of us think that sensible regulation that sets guidelines that makes sure people&#x27;s money doesn&#x27;t just go into a black hole that that&#x27;s a really important thing that regulation i&#x27;m sure satoshi wouldn&#x27;t be happy to see this kind of thing which is not based on the logic and reason that a programmer is used to i think a lot of developers understandably so try to stay out of the political nonsense it has been one of the biggest mysteries raging across who is satoshi nakamoto newsweek published an article claiming the man in these images is the bitcoin founder the man who created bitcoin is known as the father of bitcoin the online currency now worth billions when you asked him about bitcoin and he says i can&#x27;t talk about this anymore he was not referring to bitcoin but with me he definitely acknowledged bitcoin i think at this point now he&#x27;s saying he was confused by the conversation clearly somebody thought that we did this as an act of war against satoshi nakamoto or bitcoin and i want to be very clear that i certainly never meant it that way i have nothing to do with bitcoin it was a monster story how did they figure it out oh my god look at this guy that they named his name is dorian satoshi nakamoto living in california basically hiding in plain sight it becomes a gigantic media scramble and then dorian emerges from his house looking kind of disheveled looking kind of confused and says he&#x27;s not satoshi nakamoto says he&#x27;s never heard of bitcoin he doesn&#x27;t understand he had one conversation with leah she misunderstood what he said she took it the wrong way and you probably would have had to have been a cypherpunk to understand all the elements of it that had already been put together the odds of it seemed very low to me that it was somebody from completely outside that community who happened to know all these different things and put this together and appear out of nowhere the day that newsweek&#x27;s story came out naming dorian nakamoto as the creator of bitcoin i got this email from an old acquaintance that was titled what are the odds and it laid out the fact that hal finney lives less than two miles away from the known address of dorian nakamoto where newsweek had found him and hal finney is the number two ever user of bitcoin who received the first bitcoin transaction he worked on an early prototype of an anonymous currency system he was a cypherpunk so how could it be that the purported creator of bitcoin and this known confirmed second ever user of bitcoin hadn&#x27;t ever collaborated that hal finney who was less than two miles away from dorian nakamoto hadn&#x27;t helped to create bitcoin or maybe he really was the creator of bitcoin maybe hal finney was satoshi nakamoto when you look at the bitcoin white paper it made reference to a lot of the earlier projects that fed into bitcoin but it&#x27;s very notable that the one project it doesn&#x27;t refer to is nick szabo&#x27;s bit gold which is perhaps the closest precedent and the closest parallel to bitcoin i mean bit gold is so close to bitcoin it&#x27;s hard not to think that you know maybe nick is satoshi a lot of people will say nakamoto must be szabo nakamoto must have been finney but i don&#x27;t think he was trying to leave any breadcrumbs out there for anybody to follow i told my editor about it he agreed that you found satoshi nakamoto so i got on a plane to santa barbara and i drove out to hal finney&#x27;s house but at this stage he was already completely paralyzed by als this really awful debilitating terminal illness that slowly shuts down your body while leaving your mind completely intact and the time when he started to fade in his physical abilities did roughly coincide with the time that satoshi nakamoto started to disappear now maybe the reason that satoshi nakamoto had chosen to fade away was because hal finney was physically fading there have been a number of stylometric studies and you see so many of these similarities between satoshi&#x27;s writings and those of nick&#x27;s including these little things like having two spaces at the beginning of a sentence and phrases and spellings that nobody else uses so i talked to hal as much as i could mostly in a kind of one way interview because he could really only respond with yes and no answers and he denied being satoshi nakamoto you could tell that he was amused by the whole idea that i thought he was satoshi nakamoto one of the really remarkable things from nick szabo&#x27;s writing in those months before bitcoin was publically launched is that nick in responding to some comments about a post he had made about bit gold actually asked the other people who were reading him if anybody wanted to help him code this idea up into real software that could work it was never turned into a reality but when you look at bit gold it&#x27;s hard not to be struck by the similarities between it and bitcoin it&#x27;s possible hal could&#x27;ve been the coder i don&#x27;t know you know this idea that that hal finney could&#x27;ve been the kind of ghost coder for bitcoin i guess it&#x27;s possible other people kind of speculating on reddit or other parts of the internet thought that maybe hal finney had used dorian nakamoto as a patsy if he were ever traced back to dorian nakamoto it seemed like this guy was the creator and hal finney would be sort of immunized from it everyone else who was involved in the projects leading up to bitcoin has released their communications with satoshi from this period nick has avoided doing that and essentially went silent in those critical months after bitcoin was released you know when you talk to people face to face and they tell you these things you can get a sense if they&#x27;re being honest if hal finney actually had a secret billion dollar cache of bitcoins he wouldn&#x27;t have been able to lie to me so effectively about it in the end the reasons to believe that this was all just a coincidence began to outweigh the coincidence itself it&#x27;s almost like an eel there&#x27;s something there you can see it but as soon as you touch it it just slides right out of your hands and you&#x27;re left with nothing anybody who is of any note in the cypherpunk movement and even outside of it too has at one time or another been called satoshi hal finney denied it nick szabo denied it they&#x27;ve all denied it maybe one of them is satoshi maybe all of them are satoshi it really is a mystery that&#x27;s the original ticker from next door all right so we&#x27;re over here bitcoin center feet from the stock exchange over here and uh you know some of you guys took a hit last week last couple of weeks lot of the big guys they got their foothold in the business that they weren&#x27;t a part of in the beginning i don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on but uh i don&#x27;t know i wouldn&#x27;t write off bitcoin that easy i know that bitcoin is gonna change the world it&#x27;s changing the world already and we have to stand tall and proud as bitcoiners and early adopters they don&#x27;t know anything about new technology but once it starts making sense they throw their dollars behind it you know unfortunately early adopters make the roads that we all travel down and they are usually paved over in the process the first guy through the door gets shot you know but somebody&#x27;s gotta go through the door but they&#x27;re gonna get shot charlie shrem ross albricht julian assange they got shot coming through the door but we&#x27;re all utilizing the freedoms and technologies afforded to us because they knocked the door down hey michael can i put you on speakerphone for a minute if i know how hey michael can i ask you where did you buy bitcoins yeah did you lose how much do you still have them you put into it can you use it do i want to buy it no not today though it is going to be around did you ever use it to buy anything michael no okay they should go back to you know day one and just start all over forget about bitcoin call it something else i think it&#x27;s been so tarnished now with this with the silk road you know i just think you know that all that stuff about million disappearing and you&#x27;re just not gonna get off the ground nobody&#x27;s gonna you know like warren buffet said stay the hell away from it to put all the cards on the table i&#x27;m gonna be leaving the department in the coming weeks and if you asked me back when i took this job in what i thought we&#x27;d be working on during my tenure digital currencies would not have been at the top of the list so ben lawsky created this thing call the bitlicense which is new york&#x27;s attempt to regulate this scary new technology it&#x27;s now law and he has announced that he is leaving government in order to set up his own private consulting firm to help companies navigate financial regulations such as the bitlicense that he created so we essentially had this beautiful new ecosystem being built and ben lawsky comes by says i&#x27;m here to protect consumers he builds a huge wall around the thing and then he sits outside the gate charging people to get in this is the very definition of crony capitalism and for some reason ben lawsky doesn&#x27;t even see anything wrong with that i think history will not judge him as favorably as he thinks so um yeah i&#x27;ve started up my own consulting business it&#x27;s been quite interesting doing a lot of work in the fintech space but also doing work with a lot of traditional companies in the financial services world as well ben lawsky&#x27;s team at the dfs that was working on this bitlicense and the bitcoin initiative have all ended up leaving the agency and going to consulting firms that are now working on these issues danny alter is going to work for itbit and dana syracuse is going to work for the consulting firm k itbit is particularly notable because they were the first to find a way to partner with the dfs to get licensed to open their own bitcoin exchange when this is over definitely going to leave new york when i can where i&#x27;m gonna go i don&#x27;t know i think the bitcoin community in new york is done with no it doesn&#x27;t foster innovation here it&#x27;s too difficult to have a bitcoin company no banks will open up accounts you have the threat of regulation and your high profile arrests like myself and others no one wants to deal with it when did you first start digging in on bitcoin two two and half years ago when i took over the foreign exchange payments business at jp morgan so you probably had your mt gox bitinstant you know charlie and those guys it&#x27;s interesting almost none of those guys are around anymore two years ago at all the major banks bitcoin was an afterthought it was kind of a maybe in a hallway kind of conversation at the water cooler and now you know even this week i met with one of the other major banks everyone&#x27;s got a bitcoin specialist at least one working group kind of teams of people who are trying to figure out how to incorporate the technology into their existing operation banks and institutions associated with the financial system are really starting to recognize that the payment system underlying banking could be made more efficient by the application of blockchain technologies the blockchain technology underlying bitcoin has become something that a lot people are now very very interested in for all kinds of other uses whether it&#x27;s allowing for derivatives to be transferred or securities to be transferred or all manner of financial instruments to be transferred in complex interesting ways i think different companies are going to adopt different strategies and it&#x27;s gonna be fascinating to watch companies like digital asset holdings blythe masters&#x27; company doing very very interesting work i didn&#x27;t become aware of bitcoin in any meaningful sense until late in the year and at the time my perspective was one of skepticism i would say specifically because the storyline that i heard related very much to cryptocurrency as a potential medium of exchange and store of value which is a valid debate and application but it doesn&#x27;t have full extent of the power that the underlying technology has to achieve blythe masters is not just any banker she is this person who i think is really seen as being behind some of the most problematic innovations in the financial industry over the last three decades blythe is the one who&#x27;s essentially given credit for creating the credit default swap which essentially provides a way to bet on the default of a bond and the credit default swap ended up taking this place at the center of the financial crisis and these bets that banks had made against sub prime mortgages blockchain technology eradicates a significant amount of inefficiency in the system and reduces costs it doesn&#x27;t mean that we are doing away with the need for trust in financial services at all bitcoin was designed to find a way to circumvent wall street and what blythe masters is doing is essentially trying to find ways to bring wall street into bitcoin and make it possible for them to use this technology as well what the bankers seem to be looking to do at this point is create their own private blockchain where their computers are powering it rather than these anonymous miners they want control over the system the banks are looking at this incredibly wide array of ways that they might use this which include replacing stock exchanges finding new ways to originate loans finding new ways to move money between countries and of course that&#x27;s going back to the original idea of bitcoin but now it&#x27;s happening within these financial institutions rather than outside it as bitcoin had imagined i have no problem with the banking system and the financial industry co opting bitcoin primarily because bitcoin can&#x27;t really be co opted the fact that it&#x27;s decentralized means no one can control it no matter who they are or how much money they have i think it&#x27;s all good for bitcoin i think all of the innovation that&#x27;s happening both on wall street and in silicon valley i think competition will take care of people who want to try to have a monopoly or who want to try to charge more than they should for whatever product or service that is happening on the blockchain it really is as advertised it really is controlled by all the people who are using it and it really is designed just to be a more efficient more fair way of sending value over the internet bitcoin is not neutral you cannot remove the political component that satoshi implanted in bitcoin from bitcoin that&#x27;s what a lot of the people on the wall street side try to do you cannot neutralize bitcoin it&#x27;s impossible thankfully i&#x27;m gonna go to a comfy federal prison camp without fences that has pool tables and a track and baseball field and decent food and kind of to people that are white collar those guys in prison are the best ones to use bitcoin they&#x27;re smart i&#x27;m very excited to talk to them about it so yes the vcs are driving this thing right now they&#x27;re pouring money into it they&#x27;re building these for profit companies people who have a background outside of bitcoin seeing the value of it and coming to it but just because they&#x27;re doing everything they&#x27;re doing doesn&#x27;t mean that the libertarians and the utopians have to go away bitcoin is open source you can do whatever you want with it so they&#x27;re still there they&#x27;re still building their products they&#x27;re still building their vision and if bitcoin goes mainstream and if it gets picked up even if it&#x27;s running in the background there are going to be elements of that and that&#x27;s kind of what utopia movements always are the thing that the utopians were dreaming about is not gonna happen the way they expected it but i do think it is going to filter through and you are gonna see it you&#x27;re gonna see it so you&#x27;re gonna show me that satoshi nakamoto is you yes some people will believe some people won&#x27;t and to tell you the truth i don&#x27;t really care but you can say hand on heart to me i am satoshi nakamoto i was the main part of it other people helped me i&#x27;m going to come in front of that camera once and i will never ever be on a camera ever again for any tv station or any media ever&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div role=tabpanel

tomorrow ready ready let&#x27;s get him back on his feet who took office aged we await the announcement of the new cabinet in the coming days good morning your majesty your first day back at work who won who who won mr churchill your majesty by seats good for him you didn&#x27;t hear me say that mr winston churchill they keep trying to count him out but he keeps getting back up and happy moment to be elected for the second time as your prime minister what this nation needs is several years of strong steady experienced administration people singing land of hope and glory congratulations sir dr moran is here for you yes you just won a general election but over we can do better winston have a look at this for me will you in the war we used mathematicians to decode the indecipherable i need an expert to cut through the jargon are they keeping something from me well i wouldn&#x27;t be unduly concerned about the man&#x27;s pneumatics and given his age and he&#x27;s a smoker catarrhal inflammation it&#x27;s not that unusual but i would be concerned about the bronchoscopy they wouldn&#x27;t have done that unless they were looking for something far more serious and they conspicuously fail to mention the results instead they go on about the lung resection which they performed because of structural alterations what are structural alterations it&#x27;s what doctors say when they avoid using the word that it almost inevitably describes who is this man just a little one doesn&#x27;t want to overdo it one doesn&#x27;t want to look ill either a sick king is no good to anyone there must be no weakness no vulnerability oh thank you evening chronicle evening chronicle what&#x27;s that an armchair sir i just thought a man of his age this one never sits get rid of it mr churchill your majesty your majesty the people have spoken your party has won the election and as as their sovereign i invite you to form a government in my name an honor i gratefully accept my dear winston congratulations would it be terribly unconstitutional of me to say how happy i am i&#x27;ve missed our weekly chats your predecessor is a fine parliamentarian a good man but well as company as a companion an empty taxi pulled up at the house of commons and mr attlee got out quite now you may congratulate me in return what for my rapid recovery oh yes i seem to have bounced back a lot quicker than people expected yes not sure i ever imagined what breathing through one lung would feel like turns out there&#x27;s barely any difference good good though probably wise to let the princess elizabeth undertake the commonwealth tour hm what say you is she up to it yes i&#x27;d say so besides we have to start breaking her in gently don&#x27;t we do we keep one eye on the future the distant future welcome back sir what&#x27;s this it&#x27;s the teleprinter let&#x27;s have it upstairs everything as it was before sir yes everything exactly as it was before ladies ladies now who&#x27;s this oh miss venetia scott sir a new addition a good one i&#x27;d say thank you sir i had hoped i&#x27;d seen the back of this place could you give us a moment please jock thank you how was the king he talked a great deal about his recovery lots of mentions of bouncing back which always makes one fear the worst not to mention the make up he was wearing rouge poor man it&#x27;s cancer what who knows no one least of all him sir lunch let&#x27;s have it in here see what they&#x27;ve been serving for the past five years so he&#x27;s dying we&#x27;re all dying that&#x27;s what defines the condition of living will he die tomorrow no what about the day after tomorrow and the day after that the country needs to be led by someone strong well i&#x27;m strong you are also tired winston we both are a situation like that would require enormous energy and i won&#x27;t lie to you i have considered resigning for anthony&#x27;s sake for your sake but then i realized a situation like that would also require statesmanship the party needs me the country needs me she needs me who her oh her this is clarence house dining room to clarence house kitchen dining room to kitchen dining room to kitchen yes dining room to kitchen oh bugger it right check the circuits and up the amperage of the fuse wire right i&#x27;m off breakfast with your mother and margaret imagine i&#x27;m checking curtain fabrics in an hour yes let&#x27;s pick the curtains where to ma&#x27;am buckingham palace please buckingham palace i see the queen has asked to see you yes we look forward to seeing the doctor then thank you goodbye drawing room now yes we do both so love living at clarence house and he has all sorts of ideas about how to modernize it he really is rather ingenious like that actually now peter your majesty your royal highnesses i have to make a decision about christmas tell me do you think the king will be well enough to go to sandringham i do as a matter of fact i think it would do him good so it&#x27;s decided will you be joining us too me course not peter will be spending christmas at home with his family i was only thinking of papa given the choice you know he&#x27;d never let him out of his sight well that&#x27;s true he&#x27;s quite devoted to you then let me discuss it with rosemary oh no no it&#x27;s out of the question why mummy let peter discuss it well he did offer oh very well but as a wife i know what my answer would be i&#x27;d want my husband at home at christmas with his children excuse me i saw that what no i haven&#x27;t finished that look between the two of you oh margaret you must tell no one the papers all think i&#x27;m for johnny dalkeith or billy wallace mummy and papa too by the way they&#x27;re just boys whereas peter is no i quite see the attraction of peter but he&#x27;s married knock at door doctor weir your majesty you told me that after the operation i might expect some soreness some difficulty breathing but you didn&#x27;t tell me about this the coughing has returned yes how often all the time at the time of the operation as you know structural alterations were discovered of course the blockage in the lung it&#x27;s time we gave that blockage a name sir it was a tumor a malignant tumor i see but we removed it we did so what is this we removed the left lung sir but the right has fewer but still significant blockages so what&#x27;s next next i argued that his majesty should be told at the time a patient has a right to know the full picture but i was overruled the theory was that if his majesty felt he&#x27;d been cured he could throw himself into his work without undue stress and and and worry i have two questions who knows the full picture apart from the surgeons perhaps the prime minister sir of course but not the queen nor anyone else in my family no sir and the second question it&#x27;s impossible to say sir my understanding is the surgeons did everything they could and it could be years more likely months thank you in the bleak midwinter frosty wind made moan in the bleak midwinter long ago merry christmas archangels may have gathered there come on cherubim and seraphim thronged the air but his mother only in her maiden bliss worshipped the beloved with a kiss oh look oh charming quite charming what can i give him poor as i am if i were a shepherd i would bring a lamb if i were a wise man i would do my part yet what i can i give him give my heart thank you thank you thank you very good charles come on alright no mummy ma&#x27;am his majesty has requested you attend him in his study urgently requested ma&#x27;am alright will you take them i&#x27;ll be back soon off we go then in case you&#x27;re wondering i haven&#x27;t anything specific to say just wanted to spend time with you if there&#x27;s anything you wanted to ask me just fire away are they a nuisance oh the boxes not if you keep on top of them even at christmas even at christmas well what&#x27;s inside everything they want me to know they stick on top everything they&#x27;d rather i didn&#x27;t know cabinet meetings foreign office briefings they tuck away at the bottom which is why the first thing i do when no one is looking is this will you take that thank you yeah don&#x27;t you get sick of it all i do and lonely sometimes which is why it&#x27;s so important to have the right person by your side i&#x27;ve been very lucky in that regard with your mother how&#x27;s your fellow philip mm well he well i&#x27;m afraid he&#x27;s become something of a snagaholic a what well you know we&#x27;re renovating clarence house to make it our permanent home mm yes well ever since he started supervising the work he can&#x27;t look at anything without seeing its faults that switch is an inch too high and that door handle&#x27;s wrong well don&#x27;t be silly i say a handle&#x27;s a handle i should make more of an effort with him take him shooting would he like that yes i think he&#x27;d love it and then when your health&#x27;s improved we&#x27;ll return to malta and he&#x27;ll have his navy again and all will be well of course but in the meantime i&#x27;m still not yet well enough to travel not long distances anyway which brings me to the forthcoming commonwealth tour i was wondering if you would consider stepping into my shoes so to speak my health is improving but i&#x27;m still not yet well enough well if you think we&#x27;re up to it you&#x27;ll be fine where is it well ceylon australia then on to new zealand bermuda and there&#x27;s talk of starting in kenya very good right we&#x27;ll be gone months yes but it would mean so much to papa that we do it what am i supposed to do all that time don&#x27;t worry we&#x27;ll put you to work my work is as a naval officer not grinning like a demented ape while you cut ribbons what about the children the children will be fine oh without their parents for months on end daddy can you come and play i won&#x27;t be a moment

man again we&#x27;ll be all right my son in law&#x27;s a naval man we will if i can handle a frigate you understand the titles the dukedom they&#x27;re not the job sir she is the job she is the

races who have made it a great center of commerce and finance now it remains only for me to pass on the apologies of my father king george who is no doubt very jealous indeed that i have come in his place he&#x27;s getting stronger every day and he will be here with you all again very soon your royal highness may i present senior chief waruhiu wa kung&#x27;u of the kikuyu hello chief sironka of

your colleagues downstairs go on be candid it is said you can be difficult i can be a monster did they say that yes sir it&#x27;s true but you need to be a monster to defeat hitler did jock give you my box he did sir what&#x27;s in it you&#x27;d like me to open it unless you have x ray vision you will need to open it so as to be able to tell me what&#x27;s in it well some papers about rationing what else some papers from the exchequer anything from the foreign office about america or the soviet union no sir oh very well then start with the exchequer read it aloud don&#x27;t be alarmed if you hear no response i shall be making mental notes the economic situation what the economic situation we have inherited is worse than and in many ways worse worse than confidence in sterling is impaired and now our latest estimates suggest that in the united kingdom will have a deficit on its general balance of overseas payments of between five and million pounds given these circumstances i&#x27;d be interested to hear the pm&#x27;s views regarding the chances for recovery either we get rid of him now or we lose the next election and quite possibly lose power for a whole generation you must act anthony this is your time the country needs a younger more dynamic man and what do you expect me to do hmm he&#x27;s the party leader and he became party leader on our recommendation i can&#x27;t just push him out then you must go and see the one person who can welcome to sagana lodge ma&#x27;am thank you very much hello are those for me thank you very much karibu thank you apparently there&#x27;s a large breeding herd of elephants at treetops so we&#x27;ve got to get there early not too early i hope and why what else have you got in mind for our little holiday why does everybody think just because we&#x27;re royal we like fine dining don&#x27;t they realize we&#x27;re savages good for nothing but school dinners and nursery food it&#x27;s all right you can use your fingers philip look stop watch ma&#x27;am your royal highness kiss me come on his majesty will return from the shoot at pm good afternoon sir good afternoon his majesty wondered if you&#x27;d mind accompanying him on the shoot at beecher&#x27;s club today no not at all still rather wet underfoot i&#x27;m afraid after the storms yesterday but we can provide you with wellington boots there&#x27;s no need to worry what size are you sir nine and a half though my riding boots are a ten and my trench boots were an make of that what you will much of this is just a function of age he focuses almost entirely on issues relating to america and the soviet union so important domestic matters are falling behind what do you suggest i do well as sovereign of course there is nothing you can do from a constitutional standpoint but as a friend as albert windsor you are the one person i can think of to whom he might listen well that is where we run into difficulties i&#x27;m afraid i no longer am albert windsor that person was murdered by his elder brother when he abdicated and of course albert windsor would dearly love to say to his old friend winston churchill take a step back put your feet up let the younger generation have a go now but he is no longer with us and that void has been filled by george the vi who it turns out is quite the stickler and no more allow the sovereign to interfere with the prime minister than stand for office himself even when it&#x27;s in the national interest sir the national interests or anthony eden&#x27;s interest the reason i agreed to grant you an audience not to hear your grievances about mr churchill but to communicate mine about you sir the pm will step down in time and until then as sovereign i do have the right to be consulted to encourage to warn it is better to be patient and get what you desire in the right time than have high office thrust upon you when you are not ready i speak from personal experience foreign secretary your majesty sir shall we begin to walk back sir use the accelerator we&#x27;ll be all right thank you are we on foot from here philip philip looks that way sir thank you thank you your highness thank you i&#x27;m your guide

the airport for a last farewell to the royal travelers princess elizabeth and the duke of edinburgh were off on a commonwealth journey nineteen hours later the royal plane landed at nairobi ahead of

would you drive to nanyuki airfield and board east african airways c departing on a scheduled flight to as flags across the nation are lowered in tribute and news spreads throughout our cities and villages crowds gather to mourn king george vi we are comforted by the knowledge that he spent his final hours in the happy company of his wife and youngest daughter for it is as a devoted family man that we as a nation shall best remember him they don&#x27;t know sagana now man how was treetops it was wonderful we saw elephants there is fresh lemonade oh that looks delicious welcome back ma&#x27;am thank you let&#x27;s go let&#x27;s drive shall we ready steady go princess elizabeth the princess in here mhesihimwa duke excuse me sir what is it martin the profound sense of grief felt amongst his people today stems from their respect i&#x27;m very happy to no no no i should be the one to tell her yes sir the king who retired to rest last night in his usual health passed peacefully away in his sleep the bbc offers profound sympathy to her majesty the queen and the royal family your royal highness this stage of the embalming process it may distress you your royal highness for you sir they&#x27;re going to send you away but i won&#x27;t let them i&#x27;m going to tell my mother not to send you i won&#x27;t it&#x27;s all right you&#x27;re not going i won&#x27;t let you go ma&#x27;am may i have a word it appears miss macdonald neglected to pack a black dress we&#x27;ve called ahead to london and something will be brought onto the plane before you disembark right and a word of warning ma&#x27;am a good many journalists outside royal correspondents mostly assigned to cover the tour should i say something no that won&#x27;t be necessary though it would help if we could decide here and now on your name my name yes ma&#x27;am your regnal name that is the name you&#x27;ll take as queen your father took george obviously his name is was albert and before he abdicated your uncle took edward of course his name was david what&#x27;s wrong with my name nothing well then let&#x27;s not overcomplicate matters unnecessarily my name is elizabeth then long live queen elizabeth so sorry about the dress ma&#x27;am all right ready when you are ma&#x27;am shauri mbya kabisa it&#x27;s the middle of the night i couldn&#x27;t sleep no one in the country can sleep i know one shouldn&#x27;t believe everything one hears but i was speaking with jock colville&#x27;s wife mary margaret margaret she said that anthony went to see the king ten days ago what for to express his concern about your age your leadership your incapacity to ask him to bid you stand down that&#x27;s impossible the king would never engage in such treachery and anthony would never dare i&#x27;ve been like a father to him i groomed him every step of the way well ignore me then it&#x27;s probably nothing come on it&#x27;s probably nothing what are you up to it&#x27;s my eulogy for the king it&#x27;s broadcast tomorrow and the right words keep eluding me they&#x27;ll want you to fail you know i know anything less than perfect will be a disaster anthony eh i can&#x27;t sleep no i&#x27;m sorry you&#x27;re sorry i&#x27;m sorry i thought we&#x27;d have longer ma&#x27;am three hours to go now what do you think will happen when when we land what will happen then morning morning the pm will not be joining us this morning he is very much tired from all the emotion of yesterday so where is he he&#x27;s still asleep so in his absence as deputy i will preside the queen&#x27;s flight wait a minute anthony if you&#x27;re presiding over the meeting on behalf of the pm shouldn&#x27;t you be sitting in the appropriate chair i don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s entirely necessary very well so the queen&#x27;s flight is now over italy having left the el adem airfield in libya at five this morning sorry to disturb may i just say how very sorry i am that we&#x27;ll not be working together anymore why i have to give way to sir tommy lascelles as private secretary to the sovereign he&#x27;s my senior this is where i have to stand aside for the great man martin so sorry ma&#x27;am what a nightmare charteris at least had one foot in the real world and was your man our man on our side whereas tommy lascelles he&#x27;s stuck in the land that time forgot you asked to see me sir i did will you sit thank you sir i&#x27;d assumed that following the death of his late majesty you would at the earliest appropriate moment be resuming your duties with the royal air force yes sir i mentioned this to the queen the queen mother this morning who then asked me quite unusually to ask you whether you might like to reconsider such a departure oh sir she felt that you had enjoyed an uncommonly close association with her late husband and earned not just his trust but the trust and affection of the family thank you sir in the light of this she wondered whether you might consider staying on in a new role as comptroller of the queen mother&#x27;s household i see a kind and generous offer as befits the widow of a kind and generous man but while i&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re flattered i don&#x27;t expect you to accept the post hence my discouragement of the offer i didn&#x27;t want her majesty to suffer the embarrassment of a refusal why would i not accept sir well you&#x27;re asking the wrong question townsend why would you you&#x27;re a decorated war hero still in your prime and comptroller of the queen mother&#x27;s household has no military associations it would take you away from your wife and children after all the person with whom you enjoyed the uncommonly close understanding is deceased unless i&#x27;m missing something unless there is someone else with whom you enjoy an uncommonly close understanding which would make accepting this post more attractive i don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re referring to don&#x27;t you group captain townsend husband and father no sir you&#x27;re probably telling yourself that because no one has confronted you about it that no one can know allow me to disabuse you of that delusion within the close community of those that serve the family i regret to tell you that talk ugly talk unbecoming tittle tattle is of little else now i&#x27;m well aware of the toll that round the clock service takes on the private lives of those that serve i am also aware of the feelings generated by continued close proximity to the people you are working for but i would hate you to mistake those feelings for anything else will you thank the queen mother for her kind offer i should be delighted to accept there&#x27;s no rush take your time to think it over seventy two hours a week i want you to make the right decision i already have sir the answer is yes gentlemen winston impeccable timing that&#x27;s the one your majesty i&#x27;ve been asked to give you this and this ma&#x27;am from her majesty queen mary thank you thank you charteris i&#x27;ll take over from here thank you martin thank you sir your majesty martin dearest lilibet i know how you loved your papa my son and i know you will be as devastated as i am by this loss but you must put those sentiments to one side now for duty calls the grief for your father&#x27;s death will be felt far and wide your people will need your strength and leadership i have seen three great monarchies brought down through their failure to separate personal indulgences from duty you must not allow yourself to make similar mistakes and while you mourn your father you must also mourn someone else elizabeth mountbatten for she has now been replaced by another person elizabeth regina the two elizabeths will frequently be in conflict with one another the fact is the crown must win must always win ready ma&#x27;am it&#x27;s all right i&#x27;ll escort her down from here no sir if you don&#x27;t mind the crown takes precedence stand by everybody this is london three two one when the death of the king was announced to us yesterday morning there struck a deep and somber note in our lives which resounded far and wide stilled the clatter and traffic of th century life and made countless millions of human beings around the world pause and look around them the king was greatly loved by all his peoples the greatest shocks ever felt by this island fell upon us in his reign never in our long history were we exposed to greater perils of invasion and destruction the late king who assumed the heavy burden of the crown when he succeeded his brother lived through every minute of this struggle with a heart that never quavered and a spirit undaunted in the end death came as a friend and after a happy day of sunshine and sport and after a goodnight to those who loved him best he fell asleep as every man or woman who strives to fear god and nothing else in the world may hope to do now i must leave the treasures of the past and turn to the future famous have been the reigns of our queens some of the greatest periods in our history have unfolded under their scepters queen elizabeth ii like her namesake queen elizabeth i did not pass her childhood in any certain expectation of the crown this new elizabethan age comes at a time when mankind stands uncertainly poised wait on the edge of catastrophe i whose youth was passed in the august unchallenged and tranquil glories of the victorian era may well feel the thrill in invoking once more the prayer and the anthem god save the queen god save the queen&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;260&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;Crown, The S01E03 - Windsor.en.SDH&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;B2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;gina carina ella gina carina ella gina carina gina carina ella ella hello winston this is operations are you hearing me hear you clearly stand by for testing testing now testing five four three two one mummy i&#x27;ve come to make a final representation and to beseech you not to do this i wish to address my people it&#x27;s my right you have forfeited that right there are things i wish to say in which capacity you&#x27;re no longer their king as a private individual oh no one wants to hear from a private individual well i beg to differ the newspapers are for me the best thing for everyone would be if you said your goodbyes quietly privately and disappeared into the night preferably never to return i didn&#x27;t say that but you thought it admit it elizabeth margaret come inside this is windsor castle there follows an important announcement from his royal highness the duke of windsor a few hours ago i discharged my last duty as king and emperor and now that i have been succeeded by my brother the duke of york my first words must be to declare my allegiance to him this i do with all my heart come along girls you all know the reasons which have impelled me to renounce the throne i have found it impossible to carry girls girls the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as king as i would wish to do without the help and support of the woman i love this decision has been made less difficult to me by the sure knowledge that my brother has one matchless blessing come in both of you enjoyed by so many of you and not bestowed on me a happy home with his wife and children and now we all have a new king i wish him and you his people happiness and prosperity with all my heart god bless you all god save the king all right charles all right stop it well good luck darling thank you and thank you for all this it looks splendid this is the first proper home i&#x27;ve ever had tommy good morning your majesty you tracked me down slightly ma&#x27;am if your majesty has no objection i thought we might attend to the cabinet papers after your meeting with their majesties your schedule allows for minutes for the papers no ma&#x27;am minutes with their majesties then directly on to the paperwork and then things will become more manageable once everything settles down will it and once the palace is your main residence our understanding is that he is arriving at southampton as we speak alone we believe so ma&#x27;am hm that&#x27;s something some last minute adjustments to the funeral arrangements if you are in agreement ma&#x27;am we thought that the duke of windsor should join the dukes of gloucester kent and edinburgh but that&#x27;d be the row behind me breathing down my neck we could if her majesty likes increase the distance put him back a few rows any chance that could stretch to being on the steps outside the chapel i&#x27;m sorry i know he&#x27;s your son a son who gave up the throne and effectively killed my other son why not put him there close to the prime minister thank you ma&#x27;am cry baby what it&#x27;s what he calls winston he and his wife have nasty little nicknames for all of us i&#x27;ll tell you yours if you ask me nicely no thank you shirley temple ready sir this is indeed a sad arrival in my country i have crossed the atlantic for the funeral of a dear brother and to comfort her majesty queen mary my heart goes out to the widowed queen mother and her two daughters in their grief thank you down there look right that&#x27;s enough look sharp his royal highness the duke of windsor your majesty dear mama poor bertie so young one can only be thankful for all the years one had him so wonderfully thoughtful and caring an angel to his mother wife and children i honestly believe he never thought of himself at all he really was the perfect son i can&#x27;t imagine how difficult it must be for you you&#x27;ve been very much in our thoughts and prayers ours you&#x27;d be wise not to mention that woman&#x27;s name for the next few days i mentioned no name the implication was enough if you say so i offer that in the spirit of maternal advice that you may emerge from this trip with any remaining respect or affection at all i had hoped all this might wait i&#x27;m afraid not ma&#x27;am i understand shall we now the top sheet is simply a summary of all the contents of the box and we have in this case a five power conference first see that&#x27;s this one yes so this more detail so we start with this yes your majesty he&#x27;s here he&#x27;s here don&#x27;t rush darling it&#x27;ll take him an hour to get to the front door and then an hour to get through the bloody thing now don&#x27;t forget the two things we discussed i won&#x27;t the children keeping my surname yes and us staying here in clarence house not moving to buckingham palace both very important i know i won&#x27;t forget and don&#x27;t be nervous i&#x27;m not nervous you look nervous be firm just lay down the law i know he&#x27;s winston churchill and all that but remember who you are you&#x27;re nobody the queen of england don&#x27;t let me overrun the prime minister your majesty your majesty i so looked forward every tuesday to my audiences with your dear papa his late majesty was a hero to me and to all his people thank you do sit down prime minister i&#x27;ve ordered tea or something stronger perhaps oh dear did no one explain the sovereign never offers a prime minister refreshment nor a chair the precedent set by your great great grandmother was to keep us standing like privy councillors to waste time is a grievous sin and if there is one thing i have learned in years of public service it is that there is no problem so complex nor crisis so grave that it cannot be satisfactorily resolved within minutes so shall we make a start she&#x27;s in with the pm now and i made it abundantly clear how important it was that she and the children take your name it&#x27;s your name too it&#x27;s the name i gave you having mountbatten as the name of the royal house having your first born son charles as the first mountbatten king well that would be some achievement wouldn&#x27;t it now i would like to discuss your coronation yes i have a proposed date which has been run past cabinet and approved summer i hope indeed next year next year why the delay for your benefit entirely a long period between accession and coronation was of great value to your father he had five months you&#x27;re proposing i have before i am crowned yes that would take anyone weeks to read anyway thanks for the drink thank you jock sir sir foreign office first let&#x27;s surprise anthony and nothing we discussed the end of rationing of sugar butter and meat the situation in korea and the date of my coronation i barely got a word in of course not the man barely draws breath you have to butt in you can&#x27;t not in the private audience so what about the issues i asked you to address i will find the right time when why would he do that what why would he want to delay my coronation what are you talking about what elizabeth i realize we&#x27;ve had our differences in the past if you&#x27;ll allow me but for now let us think only of what we have in common you&#x27;ve lost a husband and father i a brother let us be united in grief on equal terms for someone we all loved i&#x27;ll be here for a few days after the funeral before i return to new york perhaps we might find time to see one another for lunch or a walk yes i&#x27;d like that very much your majesties we must go girls so soon yes to westminster hall to see papa with this family when you&#x27;re in you&#x27;re never quite sure that you&#x27;re in but when you&#x27;re out there&#x27;s no doubt at all you&#x27;re out why can&#x27;t you just be civil to him mummy let bygones be bygones sixteen years since the abdication and he was close to papa because the man is a monster the responsibility of becoming king killed your father and i will never forgive his selfishness and weakness in passing on the burden he has done nothing for this family and don&#x27;t be fooled by his obsequiousness the only reason he&#x27;s even civil to us is because he wants to leech off us with a rich allowance to keep that jezebel divorcee of his in the manner to which she&#x27;s become accustomed well i&#x27;ve spoken to the lawyers and we have a little surprise in store for them my dear darling peaches they say hell is an inferno what a sunless frozen hell we both escaped in england and what a bunch of ice veined monsters my family are how cold and thin lipped how dumpy and plain how joyless and loveless the way cookie treated me looking down at me through her dumpy nose it was as much as i could do not to let her have it with both barrels and shirley temple who has the rank now to silence her common mother sadly has no mind of her own but i remained civil because i am following your advice to keep them on side keep a foot in the door and see what we can get out of the wretched circus perhaps even a raise on the allowance who knows it&#x27;s the only revenge i can think of for the insult of your non invitation to drain their coffers to our benefit thinking always of you and counting the minutes until i am back in your arms your loving david and therefore commit his body to the ground earth to earth ashes to ashes dust to dust in sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life through our lord jesus christ what is that thing oh i inherited it from my grandfather well as you know kaiser wilhelm was not blessed with a normal physique no the withered arm ah but he loved to shoot so modifications had to be made they didn&#x27;t modify a shotgun they modified a cannon you are a cheat hannover i realize that beyond these walls the country mourns struggles under a program of austerity and rationing but what to do it might all appear indulgent but in keeping the estate and the local community going we are all doing our share tonight for the economy so let us start with a toast to his late majesty the king the king and the queen that has succeeded him the queen and to our generous host and the royal house that is now in his name to our host and the royal house to the royal house mountbatten to the royal house mountbatten right come on then you can do it kick it back kick it back boy go on it&#x27;s not going to bite you kick it ah it&#x27;s a burnley centre back tell me do you play football with your boy when i get to see him yeah rugby rugby chance&#x27;d be a fine thing this one doesn&#x27;t seem to want to do anything but dream ah your old man struggling a bit is he well come on then show him how it&#x27;s done right come on then charles let&#x27;s give you something to aim at that thing&#x27;s been buzzing around all morning right between his trousers yup taking aerial photographs for some magazine oh is that right mm hm it was always my dream to join the air force but dickie put me in the navy he felt the social connections would be better hm judging by where you ended up i&#x27;d say the plan worked ha come on charles bash it not bloody bad charles not bloody bad no daddy not in the bushes in the bushes he goes no daddy not the bushes right charlie boy here we go i&#x27;m going to teach you come on then oh it&#x27;s vile tommy lascelles comes up to me at the funeral of all places asks me for a word then tells me to my face do you credit it i come all this way back to this gaping wound of a country forbidden to bring my own wife to pay respects to my dear late brother and they compound an already traumatic and painful trip with this humiliation the timing does seem particularly unfortunate it&#x27;s an outrage how much is the allowance ten thousand a year the agreement between bertie and me was that i would give up everything and go into exile and keep a low profile in return for a pension that was clearly meant to be for the term of my whole life not his now he&#x27;s barely cold and cookie turns off the bloody tap how dare she you don&#x27;t know that it was her of course it was her and don&#x27;t call her that why not she&#x27;s fat common and looks like a cook did they offer any justification oh that it would appear insensitive for a member of the extended royal family to be seen to be rewarded and live in luxury extended royal family i was the most senior member of that family the king now we barely make ends meet every day is a struggle you live in great style from what i&#x27;ve heard perhaps you should take a leaf out of your late brother&#x27;s book he was frugal you know he was born frugal in every department and that frugality earned him great favour and he passed it on to the women in his family who just spent renovating clarence house so no lectures please about the frugality of the new queen that was her husband what the foundling don&#x27;t call him that why not i&#x27;d call him by his name if he had one his royal highness prince ernst august of hanover your majesty he&#x27;s here what he apologizes for the lack of warning but said it was important all right you&#x27;d better show him in ah dear aunt forgive the intrusion i come directly from broadlands what were you doing there please tell me you weren&#x27;t shooting one day after the funeral oh meine liebe ernst i assure you the sport was very limited and your late son was in our thoughts the whole time anyway in the evening we gathered for dinner the food is normally quite good at broadlands outstanding especially the duck from memory with oranges rum soaked raisins oh a prussian recipe spaetzle too remarkable crispy with cheese and breadcrumbs mmm delicious go on yes so after dinner our host started to brag about how the royal house would soon be in his name nonsense the royal warrant of established the house of windsor ah my late husband presided over it himself but the name windsor would only be carried by the male descendants it did not take into account the female descendants they would take the name from their husbands which in this case would mean mountbatten well he had us raising glasses to it glasses containing what champagne you were drinking champagne the day after my son&#x27;s funeral come in i had to see you come in i got home last night to find this on the kitchen table she&#x27;s gone all her belongings have gone i&#x27;m so sorry no you&#x27;re not no i&#x27;m not so will you sue her for divorce no i&#x27;d lose my job well you&#x27;ll keep your job i&#x27;ll make sure of that it would make me a divorcee but not the guilty party still i&#x27;d be soiled goods i&#x27;d be tainted with scandal you&#x27;d also be free to remarry one day yes down there please christ hide there there there go is it this one yeah i think so no no it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s this one right come in sorry to barge in have you got a second of course sir may i please that&#x27;s what i want to talk to you about flying yes sir you&#x27;re an experienced air jockey and i&#x27;ve an idea and look please disavow me of it if i&#x27;m wrong but to be up there in a plane it&#x27;s the biggest thrill of them all it is sir i mean really the biggest it is sir once you break through the clouds to the clear blue beyond the space the the silence the transcendent beauty it&#x27;s church for the irreligious man that&#x27;s what i&#x27;d hoped you&#x27;d say where could i learn uh white waltham airfield they&#x27;ve a good school there would you take me of course sir good man you know my sister my favourite sister actually cecile died in a plane it went down over ostend in a storm eight months pregnant she went into labour mid flight and they found the child next to her in the wreckage a boy mm mm new part of the uniform peter anyone we know i no no quite right none of my business thank you sir you&#x27;re enjoying this aren&#x27;t you yes mr colville your majesty your majesties tommy come in jock take a seat we have a significant concern which we&#x27;d like to convey to the prime minister it concerns the duke of edinburgh ma&#x27;am word has reached me that it is your desire that you and your children should keep your husband&#x27;s name mountbatten it is ma&#x27;am you must not it would be a grave mistake mountbatten was the adoptive name your husband took when he became a british citizen his real name you&#x27;ll not need reminding was schleswig holstein sonderberg glucksberg of the royal houses of denmark and norway and latterly of greece i am an old man many have questioned my relevance whether i still have something to offer in public life the answer is i have which is to leave in place a sovereign prepared for office equipped armed for her duty great things have happened to this country under the sceptres of her queens and you should be no exception yes i am queen but i am also a woman and a wife to a man whose pride and whose strength were in part what attracted me to him i want to be in a successful marriage i would argue stability under this roof might even be in the national interest had you considered that very well i will discuss it with cabinet no you will inform the cabinet prime minister that is the favour you will do me in return for one i&#x27;m already doing you i know your party wants you to resign to make way for a younger man mr eden i also know that no one will bring up your resignation while you are actively engaged in planning the coronation so by delaying my investiture you are in fact holding onto power in which case i would suggest you are somewhat in my debt so if i agree to the delay perhaps you will consider supporting me in the matter regarding my husband&#x27;s name and perhaps you could also inform cabinet that my husband and i intend to stay here at clarence house why it is our home it has just been refurbished at great expense buckingham palace can still be where official business is done but our home our private family home will be clarence house very well he was a little surprised i think really i dare express any view at all papa was always putty in his hands but i think one should start as one means to continue absolutely put a marker down quite draw a line in the sand he said he&#x27;d put it to cabinet and i said there was nothing to discuss good for you no good for you that&#x27;s why i did it thank you your royal highness thank you for coming not at all dear winston how can i help i took it to cabinet and as expected the answer was unanimous no to both matters well she won&#x27;t like it neither the snub over the name nor the move to buckingham palace it really is a most dreadful place cold uninviting but it&#x27;s the right thing for the young family and the children to live there it&#x27;s the focal point it&#x27;s the monarch&#x27;s home do you want me to break it to her that would be very kind it&#x27;s the least i can do i&#x27;ve never forgotten the way in which you defended me fought for me during that terrible time i still think no man should be punished for love and i also believe i spoke for many in the country when i defended you you&#x27;re very kind if i were to help you in this matter with her perhaps i could ask a favour in return name it put in a word with the young queen for my allowance to be reinstated she holds the purse strings now the family expect me to turn down commercial opportunities yet cuts off my allowance at the same time ten thousand pounds it&#x27;s quite impossible to make ends meet without it that a former king should come to me begging consider it done there is also a brief moment before the coronation where you might also mobilize cabinet support for the one other thing that has eluded me and gnaws away at my heart what the appropriate title for the woman i married no sir her royal highness she is after all the wife of a former king she&#x27;s also a woman who has three husbands that still live and breathe it is her right winston i&#x27;m determined she shall have it i&#x27;m determined she is shown respect will you fight for it one more time i have defended you so many times each time to my cost and in vain this love for her has destroyed everything it is love winston love the greatest thing on earth his royal highness the duke of windsor your majesty your majesty thank you for seeing me thank you for coming well most of the time we&#x27;re in paris we&#x27;ve been given a house there wallis likes to entertain she&#x27;s so good at it so the place is always full and we have dogs oh really what kind pugs davy crockett trooper and disraeli why pugs what&#x27;s the attraction well they&#x27;re childlike need a lot of loving they have a strange bark yes more of a yap and they&#x27;re lazy spend all day sleeping yes they&#x27;re awfully gassy yes i suppose one can always open the windows don&#x27;t you miss it what the country of your birth the people here your own flesh and blood well i would&#x27;ve done if they&#x27;d accepted the woman i love but they didn&#x27;t so i don&#x27;t so the former king keeps himself at a distance a distance that was imposed upon me they wanted me out and reduces us all to cruel nicknames shirley temple uh yes on account of the curls and precociousness and stardom you flatterer not at all generally we&#x27;re better at queens than kings in this country i have a feeling you&#x27;ll be no exception i certainly intend to do it well i did too obviously not hard enough no you never apologized to your papa i most certainly did your mother too i can show you the letters i didn&#x27;t mean to them i meant to me you you don&#x27;t think i&#x27;m deserving of one you don&#x27;t think i would have preferred to grow up out of the spotlight away from court away from the scrutiny and the visibility a simpler life happier life as a wife a mother an ordinary english countrywoman i&#x27;m sorry thank you you might extend the same apology to my husband the next time you see him oh is he struggling a little well it&#x27;d be odd if he weren&#x27;t anyway if i am to succeed then he and i are going to need all the help we can get well i&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re surrounded by good people offering it not if they&#x27;re always off in paris or new york or wherever it is you spend your time y you would take my advice i would particularly now my father isn&#x27;t here to give his i&#x27;d know it came from the heart since i know deep down despite everything that you care very deeply i do as it happens there are two issues on which i would like to offer some advice the first is your husband&#x27;s surname and the name of the royal house and the second there you are there&#x27;s something i&#x27;d like to discuss with you now please don&#x27;t react i&#x27;d like to take flying lessons i know but trust me becoming a pilot has been a lifelong ambition of mine and i think i&#x27;ve found a teacher mad enough to take me on as a pupil peter no less peter townsend what&#x27;s the matter i need to talk to you about what they&#x27;d rather we didn&#x27;t keep the name mountbatten who&#x27;s they cabinet it&#x27;s none of their business i think you&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s very much their business you&#x27;re my wife taking my name is the law it&#x27;s the custom not the law a custom practiced so universally it might as well be the law you can&#x27;t do this am i to be the only man in the country whose wife and children don&#x27;t take his name you can&#x27;t do this to dickie it will devastate him you know that you know how important it is to him i&#x27;ve told him the royal house mountbatten is in the bag well that was a mistake it&#x27;s not the name has to be windsor for stability there&#x27;s more clarence house our home what about it we have to give it up the home of the sovereign of the united kingdom is buckingham palace says who me i thought you hated that place i do we all do then why go along with it because that&#x27;s the overwhelming advice but that&#x27;s the point elizabeth it&#x27;s just advice it doesn&#x27;t mean that you have to act on it when it comes from the government you do what kind of marriage is this what kind of family you&#x27;ve taken my career from me you&#x27;ve taken my home you&#x27;ve taken my name i thought we were in this together door opens see daddy&#x27;s here welcome home ma&#x27;am my lords i hereby declare my will and pleasure that i and my children shall be styled and known as the house and family of windsor and that my descendants other than female descendants who marry and their descendants shall bear the name of windsor cheering&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;261&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;Crown, The S01E04 - Act of God.en.SDH&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;B2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;fuel on fuel on chocks are in position switches are off you sure about this sir when i got married my in laws made me marshal of the royal air force as a result i&#x27;m the most senior airman in the country and i

remember what i told you keep your eye on the altimeter and the compass heading and keep the stick level that&#x27;s very good that&#x27;s balanced stick to the left then to the right and level good noisy isn&#x27;t it how&#x27;s this sir my god isn&#x27;t it wonderful heaven you fought in the battle of britain didn&#x27;t you i did sir two five seven squadron flying what spitfires hurricanes

goodness me excuse me you can&#x27;t go in there excuse me sir sorry sir thought you should see these good god we must send a warning to cover our backs kenneth it should probably come from you as chief scientist address it to the pm he&#x27;ll never read it of course but the important thing is we sent it i&#x27;ll get it to downing street right away wait there please if her majesty could lean forward and deep breath in and out the air&#x27;s a little stuffy ma&#x27;am it might help to open the window a crack not while they&#x27;re rehearsing what are they rehearsing my funeral oh there you are miss scott mr thurman mr collins this is for you thank you i&#x27;m not a scientist i can&#x27;t say i understand it but what i can tell you is we don&#x27;t get a weather warning like this every day we don&#x27;t get one every month either in fact i&#x27;ve never heard of us getting one at all does the name donora mean anything to you donora oh of course i remember donora it was a scandal a small mill town in america outside philadelphia pittsburgh they had a smog brought on by a freak anti cyclone which trapped the emissions from the local copper work zinc in the fog in a few days a number of people died twenty and several thousand became seriously ill from the poisonous fog after the incident a cross party delegation was sent to donora on an urgent fact finding mission they recommended that clean air zones be set up all round london as a precautionary measure i never saw the report with good reason our prime minister threw it away claiming it wasn&#x27;t a priority can you prove that i can mr atlee the cabinet minutes where it was discussed he&#x27;s insisted the country keep burning coal irresponsibly this winter to give the illusion of a solid economy this is great clem it&#x27;s interesting for sure what i don&#x27;t understand is this why a downing street employee working for the government should come to me with this information i&#x27;ve read the aeneid mr thurman do not trust the horse trojans i fear the greeks even when they bring gifts mr atlee i entered the civil service to serve the public and to serve government any government but i am also a responsible citizen and i cannot stand by while chaos reigns around me this is not a government mr attlee this is a collection of hesitant frightened old men unable to unseat a tyrannical delusional even older one yours was the most radical forward thinking government this country has ever seen how you lost the election escapes me escapes us all i believe i would be doing the british public and this country a service if i helped to usher him out of the door and you back in and to that end you come to me with a master plan that involves me crucifying the tories for their failure to deal with a fog which as yet shows no sign of appearing at present i can see stars good night good night miss scott thank you for your conscientiousness but it&#x27;s late go home i am sir you&#x27;re no good to me tired good evening to you scott still here good night sir good night evening pat you haven&#x27;t moved i suppose it&#x27;s still a no to what coming out oh you mean going to the lamb and flag with you sitting at the bar twinkling our ankles at every unremarkable young man in the room then letting those men buy us drinks for us to bring them home only to have their unremarkability confirmed to us again no thanks goodness and what will you be doing in the meantime spend time in the company of someone remarkable ta ra hear this young men and women everywhere and proclaim it far and wide the earth is yours and the fullness thereof venetia be kind but be fierce you&#x27;re needed now more than ever before take up the mantle of change for this is your time good morning the time is eight o&#x27;clock on the th of december and here is the news london has been brought to a halt by dense fog which has descended overnight long queues have formed on main roads there are reports of motorists abandoning their vehicles and continuing on foot london airport is expected to be closed good god the meteorological office has issued a statement saying that a persistent anti cyclone over london is to blame smoke from the capital&#x27;s chimneys is being trapped at street level which is aggravating the fog the windless conditions mean it is expected to last for some time be careful out there it&#x27;s a real pea souper ah is the car ready i&#x27;m afraid the visibility is too poor to drive ma&#x27;am it&#x27;s what yards it&#x27;s been judged too hazardous ma&#x27;am i have an appointment to see my grandmother i intend to keep that appointment if it&#x27;s too hazardous to drive then there&#x27;s only one thing to be done i saw that might it be possible for you to pretend that you haven&#x27;t and the queen is here your majesty could you be more specific ma&#x27;am which queen queen elizabeth ma&#x27;am which one there are two the young one oh the queen i thought you was all queens they gave me a sheet we are i was the queen so long as my husband the king was alive but since he died i am no longer the queen i am simply queen mary my late son&#x27;s widow was also the queen but upon the death of her husband she became queen elizabeth the queen mother her daughter queen elizabeth is now queen so she is the queen bravo nurses and nuns have the same problem we&#x27;re all called sister so you are well she&#x27;s outside the queen then let her in sister bad time not at all how are you i&#x27;m always happy to see you and my mood will improve yet further if you promise me one thing name it not to ask me how i am it&#x27;s all anyone ever does forget death by lung disease it&#x27;s death by bad conversation all right i promise but if you are feeling up to it there was something i wanted to talk to you about fire away i was listening to the wireless this morning where they described this fog as an act of god now in your letter that you sent me you said loyalty to the ideal you have inherited is your duty above everything else because the calling comes from the highest source from god himself yes do you really believe that monarchy is god&#x27;s sacred mission to grace and dignify the earth to give ordinary people an ideal to strive towards an example of nobility and duty to raise them in their wretched lives monarchy is a calling from god that is why you are crowned in an abbey not a government building why you are anointed not appointed it&#x27;s an archbishop that puts the crown on your head not a minister or public servant which means that you are answerable to god in your duty not the public i&#x27;m not sure that my husband would agree with that he would argue that in any equitable modern society that church and state should be separated that if god has servants they&#x27;re priests not kings he would also say that he watched his own family destroyed because they were seen by the people to embody indefensible and unreasonable ideas yes but he represents a royal family of carpetbaggers and parvenus that goes back what ninety years what would he know of alfred the great the rod of equity and mercy edward the confessor william the conqueror or henry the eighth it&#x27;s the church of england dear not the church of denmark or greece next question it&#x27;s chaos out there trains disrupted air services cancelled at richmond bridge this morning visibility was officially measured at one yard that&#x27;s a record low incidentally our trojan friend in downing street has been speaking to his friends at the met office they say this is just the beginning they expect it to get worse i know you would have me call a vote of no confidence and will doubtless call me over cautious for not doing so but the prime minister needs to be given a chance even if it&#x27;s only to hang himself let&#x27;s see how the old fool responds there you go there you go man hey get out the way morning oh i&#x27;m glad to see someone else made it in no one saw this coming did they no prime minister sir ah you made it bravo oh i&#x27;m so sorry sir i was just no no you did well to get here i gather half the downing street staff didn&#x27;t it wasn&#x27;t easy just crossing the road you take your life in your hands well then don&#x27;t you are too important to all of us hardly all i do is bring you things to sign then take them away again and so the wheels keep turning and the business gets done and the country is governed but what&#x27;s my personal contribution you improve the quality of life for all that deal with you an ornament a flower by comparison at my age you were a published writer and a cavalry officer posted to india fighting local tribesmen on the north west frontier who told you that you asked me to engage in a relationship with a young man my own age so i have been reading your autobiography oh yes that&#x27;s not quite what i had in mind hear this young men and women everywhere and proclaim it far and wide the earth is yours and the fullness thereof be kind but be fierce you are needed now more than ever before take up the mantle of change stop for this is your time you were all energy and hope and passion and fire it&#x27;s remarkable you found something you liked in that young man i did good morning the time is eight o&#x27;clock on the th of december and here is the news the serious fog that brought much of the capital to a standstill yesterday continues this morning with emergency services struggling to cope and widespread disruption reported across the nation flares are being used to guide motorists in parts of the capital trains are stopped or running hours behind schedule from major london railway stations the prime minister is facing criticism for failure to deal with the mounting crisis london airport is closed again today with all flights grounded piss the unmoving fog which has spread to over miles wide is likely to cause complete darkness by two o&#x27;clock this afternoon are you all right you&#x27;re not come on let&#x27;s get you up no no i&#x27;m fine i promise it&#x27;s just because the window was open now go to work you&#x27;ve got a job to do let us start with the unrest in egypt where anti colonial passions continue to run high and where our soldiers continue to come under fire from nationalist insurgents it is vital that we remain and successfully defend the suez canal a point that i will be making in person to the commonwealth heads when i host them for the weekend at chequers weather permitting indeed what is the latest information that you have about the weather it&#x27;s fog ma&#x27;am it will lift eventually i was hoping for something more scientific then i will ensure that a barometric report is included in your box tomorrow complete with isobars and isohumes it has been an unusually cold winter and there are only so many things that i as prime minister am prepared to inflict on your subjects as a reward for winning a world war and prevailing over fascism evil and tyranny letting them freeze is not one of them you do not seem unduly concerned i&#x27;m not you do know that my late father wrote many years ago to your predecessors to express his deep concern about the inner city power stations that your party was building indeed and i was sympathetic with your father&#x27;s concerns at the time i also have sympathy with the leader articles in the newspapers today baying for blood wanting my head people have to be angry at someone but as leader one cannot simply react to everything we need the power stations we need the coal the people need to burn coal to warm their homes it is weather it will pass well i do hope so not least because my husband&#x27;s mood is intolerable why well being caged in like this he can&#x27;t fly fly where well nowhere he is learning to fly whatever for have we not enough qualified pilots to take him where he needs to go no he wants to fly himself it&#x27;s a boyhood dream it&#x27;s what he&#x27;s always wanted why was government not consulted because it&#x27;s a private matter and i am in favor nothing you or his royal highness do is a private matter and the father of the future king of england risking his life needlessly is quite unacceptable please do not curtail my husband&#x27;s personal freedoms any further you&#x27;ve taken away his home you&#x27;ve taken away his name there comes a time where one must draw a line in the sand and the job of drawing that line falls to cabinet ma&#x27;am not to you something your dear late papa would certainly have taught you had he been granted more time to complete your education and now our time is up until next week sir meteorological report good morning the time is eight o&#x27;clock on the th of december and here is the news the choking eye watering fog which has already caused two days of chaos across the capital has worsened overnight the great coal burning electricity stations in battersea and fulham have attempted to reduce emissions of poisonous sulphur dioxide from their chimneys but we&#x27;ve been told that it is unlikely they&#x27;ll be able to make any significant change to the air quality the government is expected to make a statement later today coughing come on let&#x27;s get you to hospital i&#x27;m fine you&#x27;re not come on let&#x27;s get you up shoes off we go arm in and the other i can&#x27;t breathe do as i say and hold onto me come along quick hold my hand make way you all right lady control of this story is getting away from us the opposition&#x27;s blood is up we have to respond respond how i would suggest by commissioning a public enquiry an enquiry would be expensive winston people are angry they see us as the culprits culpable for what it&#x27;s fog fog is fog it comes and it goes away well i&#x27;m glad that the prime minister finds time for levity perhaps i should remind him exactly how serious the situation has now become this morning a suburban train collided with a gang of railway workmen killing several and injuring a great many more in parts of the capital there is now a total breakdown of law and order hospitals are filling up as our citizens are breathing in poisonous sulphur dioxide sometimes we have sunshine too much sunshine and they call it a drought then we have rain too much rain and they call it a deluge and find a way to blame us for that too it&#x27;s an act of god bobbety it&#x27;s weather and for better or for worse we get a great deal of it on this island frankly there are more pressing matters to deal with like what the duke of edinburgh telephone sir the marquis of salisbury oh not now he asked me to stress the importance of the matter bobbety thanks for taking my call dickie are you alone yes can anyone overhear what you&#x27;re saying no good it&#x27;s chaos i know every ward is full every corridor too most of the doctors are sick now and those that are well can&#x27;t get in it was better than this in the war what do you need more equipment or masks masks are bloody useless they&#x27;re just for show to make it look like the government is doing something then what is needed money people trained staff help is what is needed urgently let her rest for now maybe i can put a word in with the people who make a difference such as the prime minister for example i see you&#x27;re just going to walk into downing street and whisper in his ear yes something like that you know my day is bad enough without some delusional girl playing jokes now excuse me nurse nurse i&#x27;ll show you get out of the way jim where are you man over here horn someone phone for an ambulance how much longer are you going to give the old man their majority is tiny a vote of no confidence and he&#x27;ll be toppled you know what he calls you yes i know a sheep in sheep&#x27;s clothing perhaps it&#x27;s time to prove you&#x27;re not very well let&#x27;s put a motion down on paper and brief the whips thank you sir anything interesting yes care to share it no i&#x27;d be happy to share glide ratios and adiabatic lapse rates with you as part of a quid pro quo arrangement one glide ratio in return for some cabinet minutes for example no a dihedral angle or an absolute ceiling these are very interesting concepts you might learn something in exchange for a foreign office briefing am i going to have to explain my position again no good once you have tasted flight you will forever walk the earth with your eyes turned skyward for there you have been and there you will always long to return you know what&#x27;s remarkable about those words go on they were written years before man first got in a plane leonardo da vinci look philip i know lord mountbatten your majesty uncle dickie what&#x27;s he doing here i know as much as you do he said it was important ma&#x27;am thank you elizabeth hello i came as soon as i could so oh is this a meeting with elizabeth your niece my wife or the queen the latter i&#x27;m afraid right then i know my place what&#x27;s the matter with him nothing he&#x27;s just feeling a little grounded ignore it right all ears i received a telephone call today from bobbety salisbury it seems that even among his own people the feeling is that our prime minister is not able to deal with a national crisis indeed he could be seen to be responsible for that crisis hospitals are overflowing people dying as sovereign you have the right to demand that a government in your name shows effective leadership the opposition are now calling for a motion of no confidence so i would say the time has come for you to summon churchill and and what insist that he go i can&#x27;t do that you can and should but wouldn&#x27;t that violate the constitution as queen you have the right to be consulted the right to encourage the right to warn also to appoint a new prime minister in the event of incapacity and many would say that churchill&#x27;s behavior now constitutes incapacity then a revolution must come from within they are trying well then they must try harder they will but would prefer it to be bloodless so have asked for your help and influence i cannot do it i will not do it let&#x27;s not forget it was churchill who denied philip&#x27;s children his own surname dickie and insisted that you live in buckingham palace as alas did everyone else and now with looters on the street and hospital corridors stacked with the dead he is interested in only one thing stopping philip flying what at a crisis cabinet meeting this morning when there should&#x27;ve only been one thing on the agenda the unfolding national emergency all our prime minister wanted to discuss was your husband&#x27;s new hobby i&#x27;m so sorry sir who are her parents her father is a clergyman from suffolk they&#x27;ve been notified i want to go to the hospital there is an emergency meeting at the house a meeting you must attend the house can wait you wished to see me your majesty yes tommy i know how much my father depended on you and how closely you worked together which is why i wanted to ask your advice now it seems our prime minister a man who&#x27;s led the country through many crises is no longer leading us at all representations have been made to me through an intermediary from the heart of the government to intercede and bid him stand down make way for a younger man which brings me to my question what are my responsibilities as head of state what should i do when it&#x27;s in the national interest how far dare i go i&#x27;m not sure if her majesty is aware but shortly before your father died the foreign secretary mr eden came begging his late majesty to intervene if not on an official level then on a personal one as a friend to bid the prime minister to resign what did my father say well his majesty was like his father before him a stickler for convention and tradition and would never have done anything that violated the constitution or overstepped the mark then i have my answer but that was his majesty not your majesty and i do read the newspapers and i do listen to the wireless and the situation we&#x27;re in today is quite different than the one we were in when mr eden came to see your father different situation different sovereign wait for me here sir just a child a beautiful child i just received word from buckingham palace the queen has requested an audience when at your earliest convenience all energy and hope and passion and fire sir do the newspapers know i&#x27;m here no but it could easily be arranged then do it and tell the queen i&#x27;ll be there first thing in the morning after the papers good god dear god just come on in the prime minister will be here in a few moments they&#x27;re ready for you sir yes yes one moment quiet please settle down mr churchill i have witnessed scenes here today the likes of which we have not seen since the darkest days of the blitz but alongside the suffering i have also seen heroism and where there is heroism there will always be hope only god can lift the fog but i as prime minister am in position to ease the suffering to that end i pledge to make available with immediate effect more money for hospital staff more money for equipment and a full and independent public enquiry into the causes of air pollution to ensure that such a calamity may never befall us again thank you all the prime minister was alone among senior politicians to visit hospitals and respond to the crisis in person and was rewarded by cheers and applause by those suffering through the worst smog this city has ever witnessed the headline reads true leader in a crisis ma&#x27;am the prime minister&#x27;s here the parallels between his appearance yesterday and the war time years was striking and his personal popularity among the people remains undimmed hello clem are you still there hello clem clem can you hear me no right the prime minister your majesty your majesty you asked to see me ma&#x27;am i did there is a delicate matter which i felt i needed to discuss with you in person concerning what your position my position yes your position as prime minister go on at that point she hesitated and then she asked me to pick either khawaja nazimuddin of pakistan or sidney holland of new zealand whatever for to sit next to at dinner no she summoned you for that oh no i think she summoned me to haul me over the coals for my handling of the fog but then the fog lifted and she had to make a decision right then and there in the room you could see the wheels turning behind her eyes and then she switched her tack without so much as a flicker clever no no not clever ingenious why because it disarmed me and made me switch tack too what about about allowing philip to learn to fly he can now good but he still has to ask cabinet permission to do rolls and spins what dear girl but what if the fog hadn&#x27;t lifted and the government had continued to flounder and people had continued to die and churchill had continued to cling to power and the country had continued to suffer it doesn&#x27;t feel right as head of state to do nothing it is exactly right is it but surely doing nothing is no job at all to do nothing is the hardest job of all and it will take every ounce of energy that you have to be impartial is not natural not human people will always want you to smile or agree or frown and the minute you do you will have declared a position a point of view and that is the one thing as sovereign that you are not entitled to do the less you do the less you say or agree or smile or think or feel or breathe or exist the better well that&#x27;s fine for the sovereign but where does that leave me so go on how long would it take me to get my wings well normally a trainee would spend anything between and hours in one of these things do you think i could do it in three months that would be unusual sir i&#x27;m a fast learner and believe me when i say i&#x27;ve got nothing else to do i couldn&#x27;t help notice you filled her right up starboard and port eighteen gallons yes fancy lunch in edinburgh edinburgh they made me duke there so i should probably show up from time to time unless you have more pressing engagements no sir all right i&#x27;ll adjust rpms and cruising speed for range flying we&#x27;ll have to land to refuel sir raf finningley oh really where&#x27;s that doncaster doncaster right&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;262&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;Crown, The S01E05 - Smoke and Mirrors.en.SDH&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;B2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;yes ah there you are come in i&#x27;m practicing for the big day tomorrow and i need an archbishop will you do me the honour from here is your majesty willing to take the oath i am willing will you maintain and preserve in invi ah inviolably it means to make a promise you can you can never break a very sacred promise indeed yes we&#x27;re ready for you sir oh not yet tommy we haven&#x27;t even reached the anointing you have to anoint me otherwise i can&#x27;t be king do you understand when the holy oil touches me i am tr i am transformed brought into direct contact with the divine for forever changed bound to god it is the most important part of the entire ceremony so we had better practice hadn&#x27;t we archbishop be thy hands anointed with holy oil be thy breast anointed with holy oil be thy head anointed with holy oil as kings priests and prophets were anointed goodness that&#x27;s very heavy indeed five pounds sir not to mention the uh symbolic weight hm there&#x27;s a sight i hoped i&#x27;d never see it&#x27;s not as easy as it looks that&#x27;s exactly what the king said i remember do you suppose i could borrow it for a couple of days just to practice borrow it ma&#x27;am from whom if it&#x27;s not yours whose is it be quiet anne ready close your eyes and don&#x27;t open them until i say so oh any idea where the duke is his royal highness went flying ma&#x27;am daddy again so when&#x27;s the big day pilot&#x27;s exam two weeks are you still on track for the record i am just if i do nothing else oh then you&#x27;ll hate me why there was something i wanted you to help me with it would&#x27;ve to be jolly important to distract me from getting my wings faster than anyone in british aviation history it is i&#x27;d like you to come aboard my coronation committee in which capacity as chairman but you already have one bernard i&#x27;d ask the duke of norfolk to make room for you i want to make a public declaration of my trust in you there&#x27;s no need to matronize me i&#x27;m not matronizing you yes you are you&#x27;re taking pity on me and giving me a job for appearance&#x27;s sake no it&#x27;s not that i was just thinking how i&#x27;d like us to spend more time together what are you talking about we spend all our time together no we don&#x27;t you&#x27;re always off flying or lunching with strange men a few hours a week darling anyway what else am i supposed to do sit around and wait for you while you&#x27;re queening queening yes queening maybe i&#x27;d like your help with the queening oh in the same flattering way you asked me to redecorate clarence house well you did that jolly well i felt like a sissy fussing about curtain fabrics and paint charts honestly it&#x27;s just queening of another sort what would it entail well the duke of norfolk will run the show from an organizational perspective look after the seating the root of the procession but as chairman of the committee you would have an input on ideas inspire everyone lead them they won&#x27;t listen to me the grey old men the men with moustaches they hate me they do not hate you they do they treat me as an outsider an irrelevance everyone does dance of the sugar plum fairy total control or nothing at all those are my terms all right but don&#x27;t go mad what does that mean it means just don&#x27;t go mad it&#x27;s the coronation a service which goes back a thousand years some things can&#x27;t be changed yes yes yes alright when did you move in the city of paris owns the property you know and happily the city very kindly let us take the house for a small amount of rent so we moved in by summer&#x27;s end miss you must have been thrilled your highness not your highness oh sore point just a duchess not hrh so ma&#x27;am ma&#x27;am or your grace what made you choose this particular house it has a two acre park which gives us privacy and its size means the duke and i can finally entertain properly and we very much enjoy entertaining the duchess is so very good at it i believe our editor agreed as part of the deal that you would give our readers some tips for entertaining did we agree that we did darling yes they paid extra hmm okay big smiles perfect but having had a naval background i don&#x27;t much care for fussy things or smells but i do like a good well milled soap what sartorial tips would you give the young men of today no matter what the fashion a well cut suit in a beautiful fabric will take you anywhere is that the sort of thing you&#x27;re looking for you&#x27;re very fortunate he lets no one in here it&#x27;s his private room full of secrets not secrets darling memories precious memories i come in here for a few moments every day to meditate and remember goodness bagpipes too yes i play when he gets homesick my favourite armchair and the briefcase box as monarch one receives a daily red box from the government state papers business of the day matters requiring royal assent that was the final box i received as king it contained my abdication papers and all these photographs of you as king there are none with the crown why is that well i never made it that far i never had a coronation i forgot to mention i had a call today from sir john weir who my mother&#x27;s doctor telling me that in his opinion she was in her final days now and my sister and i should make our way over with me probably best without even if she dies let&#x27;s hope she does couldn&#x27;t bear to go over twice i shall have to be brave my darling one and go without you to cold london brutal london hellish london shall we fuck the lord great chamberlain the lord chamberlain the marshall of the diplomatic corp and the comptroller your majesty i have asked you to join me because i have made a decision regarding the coronation committee which is that i would like my husband to be the chairman of that committee that&#x27;s impossible ma&#x27;am there can only be one chairman as far as i&#x27;m aware i only have one husband and the duke of norfolk will be expecting it to be him he is the earl marshall that may be and the chief butler of england he would be the th duke of norfolk to do it he ran your father&#x27;s coronation his father ran your grandfather&#x27;s and running the coronation it&#x27;s what the norfolks do couldn&#x27;t you give philip some other job like what arrange the photographer the chairmanship is what he wants with full autonomy therefore it is what i want norfolk can be vice chair why don&#x27;t you think about it i have and my decision stands thank you of course the duke of norfolk will be furious yes and bernard does fury so well what would your majesty suggest i will throw my hat in with bernard and sanity will prevail the queen is young and has to learn what any young general has to learn namely which battles to fight and which to leave let me know what you want me to do the same as always tommy exactly as i tell you now i&#x27;ve spoken to the archbishop of canterbury who&#x27;s agreed to help us with our other delicate matter the duke of windsor when does he arrive this afternoon i believe god help us and when will you meet him we thought tomorrow ma&#x27;am good sooner the better be sure to be firm tommy yes ma&#x27;am that one&#x27;s like mercury he&#x27;ll slip through the tiniest crack good afternoon i have returned to london to visit my mother queen mary who i&#x27;m delighted to say has made such good improvement in recent days thank you very much my dearest darling one london is as awful and hellish and as full of my smug stinking relations as ever each day i call on mama in the afternoon and although she doesn&#x27;t look quite as bad as the doctors warned me she&#x27;ll never again be able to leave her rooms far less go out in public what don&#x27;t go not going anywhere mummy good it&#x27;s one of the hardest things i&#x27;ve ever had to endure spending so much time with a woman who has been so vicious and inhumane to you my beloved is wearing me down come in sorry to disturb your royal highness what is it the archbishop of canterbury&#x27;s private secretary called sir requesting a meeting between you and his grace oh what about didn&#x27;t say sir he hoped you could make tomorrow fine i have a few errands planned but the archbishop can come to lunch as a matter of fact they suggested pm well alright we&#x27;ll give him tea at lambeth palace of course now i&#x27;m no longer king i go to them thank you good night your royal highness his royal highness the duke of windsor your grace goodness what is this an ambush not at all sir no just a gathering of old friends who have come together to appeal to you in person in the hope that you will do what we all think would be the right thing regarding what the coronation what about the coronation we acknowledge as a as a member of the queen&#x27;s close family you are entitled to attend but also feel that the attendance at this sacred ceremony by one who however good his reasons did not feel capable of undertaking the obligations himself it could strike a wrong note and would be deeply upsetting to whom to everyone concerned i didn&#x27;t ask you tommy this is cookie&#x27;s work isn&#x27;t it the queen mother&#x27;s it&#x27;s got her pudgy little fingers all over it she asked you to do her dirty work for her and you agreed archbishop shame on you i will attend if i want and i do want and so does my wife alas no sir of course the royal family is obliged to extend an invitation to you as a royal duke but that obligation does not extend to the duchess of windsor and it is my duty to inform you on behalf of the royal family and the government with whom we have worked in close consultation that she will not be offered an invitation oh that&#x27;s madness the pusillanimity and vindictiveness knows no limits seventeen years have elapsed since the abdication shouldn&#x27;t bygones be bygones some things can never be forgotten which of us for example has forgotten the somme you would compare the love and public commitment i made to my wife to slaughter in a world war why not use a celebration such as this the investiture of a new sovereign a beautiful young child symbol of modernity change and progress to turn a page surely the sophistication of a society can be measured by its tolerance and ability to forgive its weakness too sometimes lines just need to be drawn you know tommy you&#x27;re an embarrassment to the institution you serve and to the country that institution serves in turn and i will take a lecture on national embarrassment from many people sir but not from you let&#x27;s face it this whole thing is a charade you knew already the answer to the choice you have given me it is simply the same as the choice that caused all this offense in the first place namely would i do anything that excludes or disrespects the woman i love no never i will therefore not be attending the coronation of my own niece whose favourite uncle i have always been hers you should know was one of the strongest voices involved oh was it indeed well we know from where she gets that ice in her veins and it wasn&#x27;t from my own dear weak brother nothing weak about the late king sir i&#x27;m sure i speak for everyone present when i call him a hero hear hear my lord archbishop what a scold you are and when your man is down how very bold you are of christian charity how very scant you are you auld lang swine how full of cant you are a rhyme composed for your perfidious predecessor at the time of my abdication i find the sentiment oddly applicable to you too if i were to release a statement could you have a look over it of course sir i&#x27;m aware that it&#x27;s normal for no reigning monarchs to be present at a coronation perhaps we could extend that to include former kings too to spare my blushes might just throw some of the vultures off the scent it&#x27;s an elegant solution sir and i&#x27;m quite sure cabinet will support it tommy i&#x27;ll speak to their majesties and get back to you we&#x27;ve just had a call from marlborough house regarding her majesty queen mary my own darling sweetheart well at last it&#x27;s all over mama took ill in the afternoon then began haemorrhaging in the early hours doctors plied her with tranquilizers and morphine to ensure there was no suffering in the end she passed in her sleep i was sad of course but let&#x27;s not forget how she clung to such hatred for me her eldest till the last i&#x27;m afraid her blood ran as icy cold when she was alive as it does now she&#x27;s dead later in the day all the members of the family assembled to identify which of her personal possessions they would most like not entirely i told shirley temple what i had my eye on because i shan&#x27;t be there when the jackals descend i don&#x27;t suppose it will do much good what a vile tawdry rabble my relatives are and what a sad desiccated bunch of hyenas most of them have become but i&#x27;m tired of talking about it i yearn for our perfect life together away from the snarling and the sniping of the court i adore you my sweetheart more deeply than you will ever realize and i am furiously mad that you aren&#x27;t here with me as you ought by right to be while queen mary lived something of the great reigns of queen victoria and george v seemed to live on with her proving that character is as it will remain the essential strength of british monarchy wherever she went she was assured of an applause which sprang from some deep seated affection and respect have you noticed identical to the funeral of your father nothing different not one detail not one guest and she always regarded herself as a servant of our country which she served to the end no sooner does someone in the family pop their clogs right how was it done last time then let&#x27;s do it exactly the same way again i mean meanwhile the people who have come to share in it are locked outside i&#x27;m not going to let your coronation be like this you&#x27;re a young woman symbol of a new era in a fast changing modern world and i think your coronation should reflect that sorry almighty god of his great mercy sorry darling earth to earth ashes to ashes dust to dust in sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life through our lord jesus christ who changed our vile body that it may be like unto his glorious body ladies and gentlemen we should go good morning head&#x27;s up what is the collective noun for a group of stuffy old etonians a herd a pack a school thank you gentlemen i&#x27;d like to start by saying how very honoured i feel to be working with all the great minds and talents here in this room today as we come together to organize the very best coronation for my wife the queen we all know the scale of the challenge that faces us the eyes of the world will be on us britain will be on show and we must put our best foot forward in such circumstances the temptation is to roll out the red carpet and follow the precedents set by the grand and successful coronations of the past but looking to the past for our inspiration would be a mistake in my view britain today is not the britain of past coronations assumptions made at the time of my father in law&#x27;s coronation years ago cannot be made anymore that is why i think we should adapt this ceremony make it less ostentatious more egalitarian show more respect and sensitivity to the real world we have a new sovereign young and a woman let us give her a coronation that is befitting of the wind of change that she represents modern and forward looking at a moment in time where exciting technological developments are making things possible we never dreamt of which brings me to my next point it&#x27;s an unconscionable vulgarization how close are you proposing that these cameras get they will be kept at a very discreet distance no no close ups sir zoom lenses oh no it will all be done with the greatest sensitivity and respect for the occasion but i have had one or two broader thoughts about the service itself what we can both see what&#x27;s going on here a young couple are playing marital games with the most cherished parts of our history and pageantry our queen wouldn&#x27;t agree with a single one of these radical proposals television being just the tip of the iceberg she&#x27;s simply trying to keep peace in her own bed chamber by promoting her husband and keeping him happy and occupied and virile that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on here winston why what else has he proposed prime minister your majesty please tell me this has nothing to do with my husband i told him not to go mad no one is questioning the duke of edinburgh&#x27;s motives or the sincerity of his beliefs i see he went mad the changes he is proposing to an ancient sacred never previously changed liturgy and text it went from top to toe and if it were just a business it would be applauded but this isn&#x27;t a business it&#x27;s the crown and one has to ask oneself what is the purpose of the crown what is the purpose of the monarchy does the crown bend to the will of the people to be audited and accountable or should it remain above temporal matters what say you no ma&#x27;am what say you the decision is yours to make we will take our lead from you we just wondered if you might be available for a brief moment in the vestry alright what is this hide and seek i told you not to overstep the mark i made it clear carte blanche or nothing at all trade unionists and businessmen in the abbey if you want to stay on the throne yes in a trimmed down televised coronation if you want to avoid a revolution yes you forget i have seen first hand what it is like for a royal family to be overthrown because they were out of step with the people i left greece in an orange crate my father would have been killed my grandfather was i&#x27;m just trying to protect you from whom the british people you have no idea who they are or what they want oh oh i&#x27;m just johnny foreigner again who doesn&#x27;t understand fine fine you want a big overblown ceremony costing a fortune while the rest of the country is on rations have it but don&#x27;t come bleating to me when your head and the heads of our children are on spikes if the people are hungry they want something that lifts them up and how do you propose lifting them if they cannot see it the people look to a monarchy for something bigger than themselves an inspiration a higher ideal if you put it in their homes allow them to watch it with their dinner on their laps it will democratize it make them feel that they share in it understand it alright alright i&#x27;ll support you in the televising you won&#x27;t regret it on one condition that you kneel who told you my prime minister he said you intended to refuse i merely asked the question whether it was right in this day and age that the queen&#x27;s consort her husband should kneel to her rather than stand beside her you won&#x27;t be kneeling to me that&#x27;s not how it will look that&#x27;s not how it will feel it will feel like a eunuch an amoeba is kneeling before his wife you&#x27;ll be kneeling before god and the crown as we all do i don&#x27;t see you kneeling before anyone because i&#x27;m already flattened under the weight of this thing oh spare me the false humility doesn&#x27;t look like that to me how does it look to you looks to me like you&#x27;re enjoying it it&#x27;s released an unattractive sense of authority and entitlement that i have never seen before in you it&#x27;s released a weakness and insecurity i&#x27;ve never seen before are you my wife or my queen i&#x27;m both i want to be married to my wife i am both and a strong man would be able to kneel to both i will not kneel before my wife your wife is not asking you to but my queen commands me yes i beg you make an exception for me no come on they&#x27;ll be here soon david you&#x27;re our host darling be right there for the sixth time in the history of england a queen receives the crown a big day for the british public who are living these beautiful hours after the end of the war leaving buckingham palace the historical carousel

rejoice moving forwards now four knights of the garter the dukes of wellington and portland the earl fortescue and the viscount allendale bringing with them with golden canopy to shield her majesty from view during the most sacred of the coronation rituals the anointing in three two one where&#x27;d she go now we come to the anointing the single most holy most solemn most sacred moment of the entire service so how come we don&#x27;t get to see it because we are mortals is your majesty willing to take the oath i am willing will you maintain and preserve inviolably i will be thy hands anointed with holy oil be thy breast anointed with holy oil be thy head anointed with holy oil as kings priests and prophets were anointed and as solomon was anointed king by zadok the priest and nathan the prophet so be thou anointed blessed and consecrated queen over the peoples whom the lord thy god hath given thee to rule and govern in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost amen amen oils and oaths orbs and sceptres symbol upon symbol an unfathomable web of arcane mystery and liturgy blurring so many lines no clergyman or historian or lawyer could ever untangle any of it it&#x27;s crazy on the contrary it&#x27;s perfectly sane who wants transparency when you can have magic who wants prose when you can have poetry pull away the veil and what are you left with an ordinary young woman of modest ability and little imagination but wrap her up like this anoint her with oil and hey presto what do you have a goddess choir sings zadok the priest god save the queen god save the queen god save the queen god save the queen god save the queen god save the queen and to think you turned all that down the chance to be a god i turned it down for something greater still for love i philip duke of edinburgh do become your liege man of life and limb and of earthly worship and faith and truth i will bear unto you to live and die against all manner of folks so help me god&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;263&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;Crown, The S01E06 - Gelignite.en.SDH&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;B2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;more than half a million people pack epsom to

princess margaret what about her leaving the abbey on the day of the coronation i saw her picking a piece of fluff off a man&#x27;s uniform fluff yes fluff jesus bill i thought we did serious

fellow lunch club member tony longdon all night longdon thank you chaps it&#x27;s very nice to be back i must say ladies might we close the shutters please lovely i am as baron says fresh from the streets of cairo and i&#x27;m still trying to digest the hurricane of popular uprising violent military coup and revolution that i have just witnessed bloody natives you all know king farouk colourful character he owned more than a hundred cars almost as much as me had them all painted red splendid he used to race them through streets of cairo shooting at any pedestrians who happen to get in his way hear hear peasant shoot probably why he was forced to abdicate last year and now this man nasser is the name on everyone&#x27;s lips he has the charisma to unite not just his own country but the entire arab world stirring up anti western anti monarchical sentiment this is shepheard&#x27;s a famous british hotel a symbol of colonial rule before riots god and after that writing what does it say death to the imperialists however it&#x27;s not all doom and gloom mike got something a little special for you here now that&#x27;s what i&#x27;m talking about give him a tip don&#x27;t tell my wife good tip where were you today nowhere well clearly somewhere but nowhere that would interest you it&#x27;s a lunch club where soho oh with just men talking about women no talking about egypt if you must know and the revolution that&#x27;s just taken place there along with the unrest in croatia albania montenegro yugoslavia hungary italy please take note yes a little bit about the fairer sex over coffee and the odd brandy what do you expect it&#x27;s a gentlemen&#x27;s lunch club so what&#x27;s the guest list for tonight no one just you me margaret and oh peter what townsend peter why on earth did we have to dress up she insisted she wanted to make it a special occasion with him isn&#x27;t that a contradiction in terms he&#x27;s not been a naughty boy has he i know as much as you do it will be fine come on we&#x27;d like to be left alone now yes ma&#x27;am just leave it thank you excuse me i asked you here tonight because there is something i wanted to discuss with you i think you already know that over the years with peter being so much part of our family and away from his own so much a friendship has developed between us and then ever since papa&#x27;s death hitting me so hard and with your succession and coronation and you being more and more occupied peter has become almost my sole companion and i his and so when his divorce came through in december last year i suppose it was only natural that we both started thinking about what kind of future we might have together and we have reached a decision in april wasn&#x27;t it just before the coronation that one day we wanted to well you know marry yes goodness well of course we&#x27;re aware of the complications and issues at stake oh lilibet you&#x27;ve known for a while about peter and i this can&#x27;t really be a terrible shock to you no not at all it&#x27;s wonderful is there anything you&#x27;d like to ask us does your wife know no ex wife she does we had a frank conversation there is no animosity oh good and the boys they know and seem very happy so do i have your permission as sovereign oh well of course i&#x27;ll have to take advice on the how&#x27;s and where&#x27;s and all official matters but if it&#x27;s what you desire more than anything in the world then as your sister i&#x27;m never going to oppose it oh thank you thank you thank you i&#x27;m so happy i&#x27;m so happy oh well congratulations both of you thank you sir i suppose it had better be philip from now on thank you sir oh philip you knew not the extent of it but you didn&#x27;t think to mention it i don&#x27;t like it any of it for one thing it will create the most enormous scandal nor do i believe in them as a couple he&#x27;s too old for her and he had some sort of breakdown during the war now that&#x27;s all in the past besides that&#x27;s why he got on with my father so well not to mention the fact he&#x27;s dull he&#x27;s not dull desperately dull i&#x27;m confident i&#x27;ve met more interesting plants not to mention it&#x27;s a terrible thing to do to you why because of the position it puts you in as a sister and as a queen has everyone forgotten the catastrophe that was your uncle already the situation&#x27;s different one party divorced the other royal sounds pretty similar to me that was years ago the world has changed the rest of the world has nothing changes in the court of st james besides we have a son and heir there&#x27;s no realistic prospect of margaret becoming queen and one can see the attraction in peter yes he&#x27;s a handsome war hero divorced war hero and blameless in that divorce no there&#x27;s no such thing as a blameless party in a divorce his wife had an affair with another man because he was always around here sniffing around your sister he was looking after my father and sniffing around your sister stop it anyway i thought you liked him liked him i mean i respect him for what he did in the war certainly he plays bridge well and he&#x27;s a good pilot and he&#x27;s a good influence on margaret is he if he were a good influence he&#x27;d patch things up with his wife and leave margaret well alone night bill goodnight potentially goodnight sir yeah this had better be good it is bloody hell you did say peppery pepper is one thing this is gelignite i know what are you doing i can&#x27;t run this without going upstairs what don&#x27;t look at me like that live in the real bloody world for a moment will you margery hello yes is he there yeah just for a few minutes this is not just inflammatory it breaks all the rules what rules sir the unspoken rules of deference and respect shown by the media to the royal family but surely those rules changed the moment they invited television into the coronation that was their right and a huge concession to what popular interest their interest also look at their standing now it&#x27;s never been higher the question we in the fourth estate need to be asking ourselves is do we let ourselves be used or do we have our own independent voice don&#x27;t get moralistic with me if we don&#x27;t break this story do you think nobody else will i know there&#x27;s plenty of others sniffing around it sir oh thank you for letting me know of course tommy thank you for understanding i&#x27;m sorry no i&#x27;m sorry i imagine it must be difficult being dictated to like that by an employee i wasn&#x27;t dictated to am i missing something you said this editor was telling you what he was going to print in your newspaper he is but i can&#x27;t keep telling him what to write i thought that was the point of owning a newspaper look i&#x27;m just trying to help you tommy i suggest you see this for the kind gesture that it is what that you are about to print an article that will cause deep distress to senior let&#x27;s be quite clear the most senior members of the royal family that i&#x27;m warning you that i&#x27;m giving you the heads up i&#x27;m on my knees with gratitude infernal galop stop can you shut that your majesty a story is about to break in the press identifying peter townsend not just as the companion of princess margaret but as her likely future husband we understand that the paper is to feature a profile of group captain townsend details of his marriage and subsequent divorce along with an editorial about other notable divorcees to have been associated with members of the royal family should we deny it all with respect ma&#x27;am it&#x27;s a little late for that this horse has already bolted your royal highness her majesty the queen for you your royal highness on the telephone hello hello you bad time good time good time always look i&#x27;ve been wracking my brain about how i can best help you now you know that the church of england doesn&#x27;t permit the remarriage of divorced persons if the husband or wife of the former marriage is still alive yes well i was just wondering if you and peter had considered scotland to live no for the wedding why because it would be more low profile well actually i was thinking of legal reasons marriage isn&#x27;t regarded as a sacrament in the church of scotland it is not as binding in the same way as here meaning meaning we could even get married in a church well i&#x27;d have to check but i think so that would be so lovely lilibet thank you so much it would make my life a lot easier too sorry lilibet what for i think you&#x27;re going to get a visit from mummy about all this oh i realize i&#x27;m not making anyone&#x27;s life easy yours especially but i&#x27;m determined to do this for you to give you what you want thank you i can&#x27;t wait to tell peter i&#x27;d better go tommy your majesty mummy this is a surprise i am a mother of two daughters whom i love equally it seems that they each have problems of equal size obviously we want margaret to be happy to have the man she wants yes but we must do everything in our power to protect you as queen and as a sister protect me from what i&#x27;ve given margaret my word and i&#x27;m determined to support her they can marry in scotland where i&#x27;m not head of the church your majesty i fear the matter is more intricate let&#x27;s be quite clear if margaret were to marry peter it would be a scandal don&#x27;t mistake your current popularity for long term security your uncle&#x27;s affair and abdication almost destroyed the monarchy this could too tommy ma&#x27;am what do you know about the royal marriages act of george ii third ma&#x27;am he had two younger brothers william and henry both of whom i&#x27;m assuming made undesirable marriages one to an illegitimate shrew the other to a disreputable jade which caused an outrage in parliament and the church now in response george iii asked his prime minister lord north to rush through a royal marriages act to prevent any future wilful young prince or princess from making an ill advised or disadvantageous match which might threaten the integrity of the royal house it decrees that until the age of any member of the royal family must secure the sovereign&#x27;s permission to marry but but not thereafter i see so if margaret were to wait until after her th birthday she would be free to make any decision she likes without your consent the important thing is it protects your relationship with both church and government well i can see the advantages of that but what&#x27;s in it for her mummy she&#x27;s only what does she do in the meantime in the meantime she and peter wait preferably in separate countries what it&#x27;s the only way to contain the story ma&#x27;am thank you sir good morning sir out of my way come margaret no margaret just until your th birthday then you would be free to do as you wish look me in the eye and tell me is it a posting or is it a banishment it&#x27;s a posting i promise it&#x27;s just a way of managing the story keeping it off the front pages not a heartless attempt to split us up no of course not papa did the same for philip and me he made us wait for three months this is for two years think of it two years why did you even dangle scotland under my nose sorry all right if i do this for you will you promise me that this banishment posting this banishment won&#x27;t start until after our trip to rhodesia you know how much we&#x27;ve been looking forward to it you&#x27;re going to deny us that as well it&#x27;s the sensitivity of you two together the photographers it would overshadow everything but when you get back you&#x27;ll have some time together alone i promise you that they offered me johannesburg i refused then singapore i refused that too then they came back with brussels it&#x27;s dreary but at least it&#x27;s close the whole thing feels like a completely unnecessary unjustifiable punishment i know perhaps your sister sensed that that is why she&#x27;s asked me to go to northern ireland what for to accompany her on her trip to belfast this week to put on a show of public approval that&#x27;s something i suppose no substitute for rhodesia though no one wanted philip she dug her heels in got the man she wanted didn&#x27;t she she did we ought to head back come on no wait kiss me you know we won&#x27;t be able to back at the house your majesty tommy just to run through the order of the day yes we&#x27;ll be met at the airport by the governor of northern ireland lord wakehurst from there we will be going to the belfast city boundary to be met by the lieutenant of the city of belfast after that we will be presented to the lord mayor alderman percival brown and the town clerk john dunlop followed by a city luncheon at civic hall the other way around i think ma&#x27;am a civic luncheon at city hall forgive me is everything all right i do hope it wasn&#x27;t a mistake inviting the group captain to join us you&#x27;ve never cared for him tommy no i cared for him as long as he did his job and knew his place my father held him in high regard as a member of staff not as a member of the family he has been a good friend to us all too good i would argue and he let his wife go in the process he was innocent in that regard she left of her own accord and he&#x27;s a wonderful father to those boys i&#x27;m just trying to manage a difficult situation ma&#x27;am as am i sending him away will break my sister&#x27;s heart hearts mend was there anything else no your majesty bringing her majesty the queen on a visit to northern ireland her majesty now walks towards three year old eileen hall who presents her with a bouquet the queen who wears a coat of vivid blue shantung with a matching hat finds herself sharing the limelight with group captain townsend who accompanies her on the tour the crowd get a last glimpse of the queen and her husband before they begin the drive to city hall en route thousands pack the streets to bid them welcome the royal couple are welcomed onto balmoral showground where ex servicemen and women are gathered to pay tribute to their sovereign many ulster schools and youth organizations are represented and they all have a smile and a wave for the queen as london papers called once more today for a statement from buckingham palace to clarify the rumours of a romance between princess margaret and group captain townsend newspaper editors from all over the world sent their photographers to scrutinize townsend&#x27;s face hoping for a clue the queen can&#x27;t be used to sharing the limelight with a member of her household but the gathered crowds certainly seem as interested in group captain townsend as in her majesty turn it off certainly ma&#x27;am the crowds had to jostle with members of the press and television for following the royal party&#x27;s every move i brought him along to show my gratitude for his years of service and to support my sister and i had hoped that attention on margaret and peter would fade away but i could barely hear myself speak today the solution is an obvious one which is bring forward the group captain&#x27;s relocation with immediate effect but that would mean him missing his reunion with my sister in london and i gave her my word well sometimes best intentions need to be reconsidered your majesty you can always blame it on me no let&#x27;s wait hours things might calm down tomorrow your majesty your majesty the lambeg drummers ma&#x27;am a special orangemen&#x27;s welcome townsend captain townsend townsend captain may god give you wisdom loyalty and faithfulness and may the future bring peace contentment and true happiness to the people of northern ireland townsend townsend townsend do you have a moment lilibet yes of course i just wanted to apologize for all the press attention and to thank you for inviting me along in the first place i do appreciate the gesture it&#x27;s the least i could do i regretted having to take you off the rhodesia trip yes margaret and i were so looking forward to it we have so many shared interests as you know we enjoy doing everything together we had hoped to find some time together during her days off walking swimming riding but not to be no anyway nice chatting ma&#x27;am if you wouldn&#x27;t mind just wondering if her majesty has had time to think about the matter she has take care of it tommy in whatever manner you see fit yes ma&#x27;am thank you your majesty good night sir thank you so much peter ma&#x27;am group captain townsend the man of the moment do come up will you sit following consultation with the government the foreign office and her majesty&#x27;s press secretary the decision has been taken to move forward your posting to brussels with immediate effect a car is waiting to take you first to your apartment where you will pack and then directly to the airfield the plane for brussels leaves in just under three hours there was some concern that that might not give you enough time but i felt sure that as a military man packing quickly and unsentimentally would come as second nature to you but that isn&#x27;t what was agreed the agreement between margaret and her majesty the queen with the certain knowledge of her majesty the queen mother was that margaret and i were to spend some time together upon her return from rhodesia before i travelled to brussels forty eight hours at least your proposal is a direct contravention of that agreement well i cannot nor would i ever presume to know the intimate details of whatever agreements have or have not been made within the family what i can tell you is that the position of air attach at the embassy fell vacant unexpectedly early and needs filling right away of course a crucial position like the air attach to the embassy at brussels cannot be left vacant for very long i ask only that it remain so until after the princess returns as i was promised i&#x27;m afraid that will not be possible tommy i understand you&#x27;re only trying to do your job but one thing the trip to northern ireland has made very clear to me is that the romance between margaret and myself has caught the public eye there is a momentum for us a sense of joy and celebration which you would be wise to acknowledge the people can clearly see the sincerity of the love between margaret and me and i would advise you not to reprehend us for that such an act could backfire and now if i may give you some advice in turn peter that when referring to a member of the royal family you use the appropriate title in this case her royal highness when referring to the woman i love and who loves me and who is soon to be my wife i&#x27;ll call her what i damn well like her name is margaret car townsend waiting tick tick tick bon voyage a tiny white community surrounded by primitive africans grew into a young and flourishing nation with the ever brightening promise of more prosperity before it hurry up yes sir we honour a man of remarkable vision who saw how great this land could become once civilized i wish continued prosperity and success to all those who inhabit it ladies and gentlemen please stand for the royal courtesy telegram for princess margaret the queen to the queen god save our gracious queen long live our noble queen god save the queen send her victorious thank you madam thank you long to reign over us god save the queen i need to speak to my sister now switchboard her royal highness needs to make an urgent call to her majesty the queen a secure line will be required putting you through foreign office how may i direct your call buckingham palace victoria i have her royal highness the princess margaret for her majesty the queen sir sir princess margaret for her majesty the queen on a secure line of course what&#x27;s taking so long well i gather we have the secure line ma&#x27;am they&#x27;re just having trouble locating her majesty what can be so difficult she&#x27;s the queen she&#x27;s fairly conspicuous she can&#x27;t disappear sandringham house good evening yes sir she&#x27;s here arrived about an hour ago yes sir right away ma&#x27;am i&#x27;ve located the queen the strip made up for it at ascot but we&#x27;re really trying not to let this happen again i think he&#x27;s a little bit inexperienced what the jockey ma&#x27;am yes i do telephone your majesty right yes i&#x27;d like his scope recorded for the first quarter mile tomorrow morning yes ma&#x27;am and then we might have to think about pairing him with another rider yes ma&#x27;am yes how could you margaret you gave me your word promised me he&#x27;d still be there when i got back i did why has he been sent away banished like some criminal things got out of hand i took you at your word believed everything you said how happy you were for me how you would support us margaret you&#x27;ve been against us from the beginning because you can&#x27;t bear to be eclipsed what can&#x27;t bear to be outshone by your younger sister you&#x27;ve never liked it admit it you&#x27;ve hated how peter and i caught the popular imagination hated it enough to want to destroy it this is madness well you fail to protect me i will fail to protect you in return margaret you reap what you sow sister the laws of england say that any man once divorced is fully entitled to marry again if those laws are good enough for england they are good enough for the royal family i know but the near holy reverence shown for the crown by the people of britain is a fact of life as the recent coronation has shown few other countries in the world retain such regard for their monarchies but are those centuries of awe drawing to an end can that veneration be sustained in the light of the royal family&#x27;s cruelty to its very own members the royal family in britain has survived a thousand proofs that it is artificial and superfluous and seems to have as deep a hold as ever on the loyalties of the people it is not likely however to survive the clear proof that it is insensate and cruel the treatment of her sister has now jeopardized the future of the monarchy in britain in hours it will have passed if you&#x27;re lucky i fear it will take longer than that for margaret to forgive me she will in time she has to we all have to your majesty be right with you hello mike where are you going i told you i was away for the weekend did you baron&#x27;s having a house party who&#x27;s baron baron nahoum president of our lunch club don&#x27;t look like that it&#x27;s gentlemen only right absolutely perfectly innocent shall we old boy yes i think let&#x27;s snifter en route eh toodle oo&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;264&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;Crown, The S01E07 - Scientia Potentia Est.en.SDH&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;B2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;so it is always the sovereign who begins the meal it is absolutely forbidden to begin before he or she takes their first bite oui mademoiselle during the meal when it is the first course you must only speak to the person seated on your right until the end time for the vice provost lilibet your royal highness come on there are two elements wrote walter bagehot in the efficient and the dignified which is the monarch your royal highness the dignified very good the efficient has the power to make and execute policy and is answerable to the electorate what touches all should be approved by all the dignified gives significance and legitimacy to the efficient and is answerable only to god precisely two institutions crown and government dignified and the efficient only work when they support each other when they trust one another you can underline that do you teach this to your other pupils no just you this is what i teach them these are exam papers shouldn&#x27;t i know all of this too no ma&#x27;am all very undignified i see mr einstein has changed his mind again oh the scientist no i know who he is what exactly has he changed his mind about that&#x27;s rather less clear to me but everyone&#x27;s making a tremendous fuss about it at the time of my education i asked the vice provost if we shouldn&#x27;t spend a bit of time on literature philosophy science he felt i had enough on my plate as it was but don&#x27;t you think i should have learned about it why well doesn&#x27;t one have a duty to know certain things you have a great many other virtues you can&#x27;t be expected to know everything well no that&#x27;s the point mummy i know almost nothing you know when to keep your mouth shut that&#x27;s more important than anything and that would&#x27;ve been fine if i&#x27;d gone on to live a normal life but now i spend so much time with politicians and statesmen you know i live in dread of being left alone with them your dear papa was just the same be nice to think that one could if not hold one&#x27;s own then at least not have to steer the conversation away to dogs and horses every time the prime minister&#x27;s on his way ma&#x27;am well one good thing about this one is you never have to open your mouth at all that&#x27;s true just smile politely while he drones on and on your majesty may or may not be aware but this is my retirement year is it really how long has it been years ma&#x27;am serving four sovereigns one can hardly imagine the place without you it&#x27;s kind of you to say so ma&#x27;am but we&#x27;re well prepared for the transition a deputy&#x27;s long been groomed and made ready two deputies right yes ma&#x27;am a senior and a junior an heir and a spare quite well before we discuss any of that i&#x27;d like you to know how grateful we all are to you for your years of service thank you ma&#x27;am my father was quite dependent on you you know that and in our short time together i could see how i could be too but you deserve to put your feet up and i think i could work quite well with martin charteris martin charteris yes i assume you&#x27;ll give that your blessing martin is the junior deputy private secretary ma&#x27;am the spare michael adeane is the senior the rightful heir yes but martin and i have worked together before i&#x27;m aware of that i&#x27;m sure michael would understand that i had a pre existing relationship with martin and not take it personally martin is a younger man it&#x27;s the more natural fit if that is your majesty&#x27;s wish prime minister i&#x27;m so sorry to have kept you waiting not at all oh but i see you&#x27;ve found company yes honey sugar pippin say goodbye thank you tommy shall we make a start one item overshadows every other on the agenda this week ma&#x27;am the soviets and their h bomb we now have confirmation that they have been testing in the kazakh desert it is vital that we act swiftly to secure peace and vital that we british spearhead the effort i have always been the person everyone wants in a room with the russians because stalin would only talk to me with him gone there is a great danger that eisenhower will take it upon himself to run the show and that would be bad oh a disaster ma&#x27;am for all the obvious reasons of course remind me of the obvious reasons russia is a great old empire which demands and deserves respect americans like to wave the big stick and speak with a loud voice in the matter of world governance they are not yet ready they need an experienced and elder power to guide them school them yes we could all do with some school to that end i&#x27;ve asked the foreign secretary to go to washington to lay plans for a summit meeting between myself and eisenhower to start discussing a unified approach for how to bring the russians back into the family do you think he&#x27;s up to it eisenhower no the foreign secretary anthony is the finest foreign secretary this country has had for generations yes but i&#x27;ve heard he&#x27;s also a very sick man i would hate to think that the country wasn&#x27;t in safe hands being led by healthy men we are both fine ma&#x27;am i assure you early indications are that the bomb they tested was a fission and fusion fueled sloika design based on lithium six deuteride and uranium two three five with a yield of kilotons khrushchev claims the weapon is ready for immediate use capable of deployment from a bomber aircraft he was bragging about it to the presidium last week do we believe that latest cia intelligence seems to support it with the soviets known to be ramping up their production of long range bomber aircraft are you all right sir my bag please give me my bag you can do this sir this really should be done by a doctor just find a vein come on now we can say with confidence that joe four&#x27;s total yield why was in the range of four to kilotons now intelligence sources indicate the soviets used the layered design similar to our own ivy mike detonation in &#x27; which is consistent with the blast radius the british foreign secretary that gentleman is not just a sleeping man it&#x27;s a sad metaphor the second most powerful man in what was once the most powerful country on earth what&#x27;s that on his arm looks like blood sir good god colonel charteris your majesty you asked to see me i did do sit down now as i&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re aware tommy lascelles will be leaving us shortly to begin his well deserved retirement and his departure will leave something of a gap yes and i was wondering whether you might be interested in filling that gap as what ma&#x27;am my private secretary i&#x27;d be delighted but but what what about michael adeane what about him he is the natural successor i was hoping it might be possible for me to make my own decision just once there are two private secretaries to choose from and i happen to prefer the junior so shall we say that&#x27;s that yes i suppose we shall good thank you is there anything i can do in the meantime no no no thank you martin actually martin a tutor ma&#x27;am i&#x27;d like to engage one any particular field general education i&#x27;ll come up with some names thank you oh and martin preferably one you know not too stuffy sense of humor understood i&#x27;m no stranger to pain winston but this has become intolerable i must have corrective surgery and this corrective surgery must it really be boston that&#x27;s where the best man is the only man they&#x27;re better equipped to deal with gall bladder problems in america due to the high fat diets they have here leaving me without you for the summit with ike can&#x27;t you delay it no i can&#x27;t besides you have already stated your ability to run the ship without me for some time in jest my dear boy when you become mutinous and presumptuous you know how much i depend on you i do well but i&#x27;d still like to hear you say it again what i&#x27;d like you to say it again so that all the people listening in can hear you were saying that i depend on you anthony what for for your judgement what else your integrity and loyalty louder please yes all right yes i need you there anthony i think we&#x27;re all agreed i need you and i need the surgery winston it&#x27;s my life that&#x27;s at stake now i&#x27;m sorry prime minister prime minister what&#x27;s that here charles that one look look at this do you like my picture it&#x27;s a rocket one day it&#x27;ll take us into space let&#x27;s move on professor hogg your majesty who colonel charteris said you were expecting him oh yes where&#x27;s mercury high up in the sky charles it&#x27;s where all the other planets are your majesty professor hogg during the course of my new daily life i have to spend a great deal of time alone with statesmen men like yourself of exceptional intellect who&#x27;ve risen to the very top of their profession by virtue of their intelligence and their ability there are frequently times when i am discussing agendas of the day with these people that i find myself on the back foot at something of a disadvantage because i i can&#x27;t keep up or i don&#x27;t know what lies behind something and that&#x27;s no way to live to be uninformed and entirely at someone else&#x27;s mercy quite which is why i was hoping that you might help me hold my own some more feel at less of a disadvantage fill in fill in some of the gaps perhaps her majesty would give me an idea of roughly how far she got when with her education in what sense which exams she might have taken and passed that i might better know at what level to pitch our tutorials the higher school certificate for example all right the school certificate then no any privately tutored equivalents thereof perhaps i see her majesty the queen ma&#x27;am this is a surprise to what do i owe the pleasure i came because i wanted to ask you a question about my education what about it the fact that i didn&#x27;t receive one you did sewing needlework and saying poems with crawfie that is not an education darling you also spent years one on one with the vice provost of eton college being drilled in the constitution which is far more than your sister ever got mummy i&#x27;m talking about a normal education in normal subjects you received an entirely appropriate education for a woman of your background which has entirely failed to prepare me for the life i lead now we taught you how to be a lady a princess what do you want a degree no one wants a bluestocking or a college lecturer as sovereign they want a queen yes a queen who is hopelessly ill equipped to deal with the people that she has to meet what has this to do with me how could you have let me down like this is this a criticism of my motherhood i would&#x27;ve thought you&#x27;d think twice before throwing stones on that score what&#x27;s that supposed to mean i hardly see you blazing a trail in that department that&#x27;s not fair besides i thought we were past the age now where we take cheap shots at our parents i educated you as your father and i saw fit why didn&#x27;t we push harder no one advised that we should that includes the vice provost oh don&#x27;t force something that doesn&#x27;t come naturally dear that&#x27;s what i&#x27;ve learned we all have to accept our limitations in life that&#x27;s it there the grace and favor flat belonging to the queen&#x27;s private secretary our new home how much of the ground floor is it all of it including the rooms stretching to the back the girls will be happy here now we must go i don&#x27;t want anyone to see us why well it&#x27;s just indiscreet and i haven&#x27;t got the job yet what about that tree it&#x27;s blocking all the light well i daresay one could ask to have it trimmed back will you ask i don&#x27;t see the rush but yes i can ask discreetly good god a stroke bobbety that&#x27;s all a minor stroke but i&#x27;m on the mend bouncing back well you don&#x27;t look very bouncy to me who knows no one and no one can know especially the queen what i have promised her that the country will always have a healthy man in charge you know me bobbety i am a man of my word but you can&#x27;t just hide it from her i mean you&#x27;re head of the government which runs the country in her name don&#x27;t you think she&#x27;ll smell a rat when no one turns up at her private audience the palace has been told that i have a cold a cold jock you have my permission to extend that to the flu sir but no more and what about the meeting with eisenhower in washington alas as i have been refused permission to fly i am left with no option to postpone it are you mad the russian situation could not be more delicately poised nor more needing of my influence no we have to get eisenhower here you see tommy there&#x27;s no other way well how about the th of july i doubt it all right the th i doubt that as well the th then i can put it to her bobbety but i wouldn&#x27;t hold your breath well i&#x27;ll leave it to your powers of persuasion goodbye sorry to disturb you ma&#x27;am but i just had lord salisbury on the phone with an unusual request president eisenhower is due to meet the prime minister in washington for a summit next week but mr churchill&#x27;s developed a cold a nasty cold and lord moran his doctor has forbidden him to fly now the feeling is the meeting is of the utmost importance so downing street was wondering whether we might be able to help help how by inviting the president here where here ma&#x27;am to buckingham palace to a state banquet next week the feeling is that by that time winston should have made a sufficient recovery well i was planning on going to sandringham i&#x27;m afraid it would mean postponing that by a few days we can extend an invitation through our ambassador in washington is that a green light ma&#x27;am yes then if you&#x27;ll excuse me i better get cracking do you have a moment tommy i need to speak to you urgently i don&#x27;t i&#x27;m afraid i have a state banquet to arrange so if it can possibly wait until later i think when you hear it you&#x27;ll share my sense of alarm it seems that martin charteris is to replace you as her majesty&#x27;s private secretary not me what says who says margaret colville jock colville&#x27;s wife who plays bridge with alice jameson lady in waiting who as you may know plays tennis with mary charteris why on earth would i know that anyway so confident are they of the appointment that mary has even gone so don&#x27;t tell me so far to speak to the palace head gardener about trimming the tree outside my window yes ask martin to come and see me would you that is if he and his lady wife are not too busy measuring carpets and curtains for what is still my home right it&#x27;s green light jump to it sir you asked to see me tommy i did do sit down martin you&#x27;ve worked for the palace now for what three years i&#x27;d have thought that long enough for you to know the ropes understand the rules the way things are done i think i do manifestly not professor hogg your majesty your majesty professor i know you were going to prepare some tutorials of a more general nature but it seems i&#x27;m going to need some more specific knowledge first on which subject president eisenhower he&#x27;ll be coming here in a matter of days and i&#x27;ll be expected to sit next to him and make conversation with him so i need to know all about him and what interests him the military industrial complex ma&#x27;am what and its threat to democratic government it&#x27;s what most concerns him something lighter perhaps golf anything else oil painting i&#x27;m told he paints landscapes oh don&#x27;t they all would your majesty give me hours to do some research and come back to you yes of course he was baptized wasn&#x27;t he just six months ago yes i think i read about that a presbyterian did they dunk him do you think dunk a full immersion in some river if i were a gambling man i&#x27;d say yes are you occasionally the derby ma&#x27;am and the grand national oh how did you get on this year at the national rather well i had early mist on an each way bet oh well done you you won by lengths i share your admiration for mr o&#x27;brien and everything he&#x27;s doing at ballydoyle stables who the trainer that&#x27;s not why you backed him no i just liked the name i see back in hours thank you i&#x27;m so sorry to hear that in these past days you&#x27;ve not been in your usual good health isn&#x27;t that nice and that your tireless exertions on behalf of this country have resulted in this temporary inconvenience temporary inconvenience how much does she know exactly because from the tone of this winston she thinks it&#x27;s a cold a cold yes a cold if she knew the truth she would bid me stand down good a replacement would have to be found the wrong replacement because the right man anthony is himself incapacitated too much knowledge can be a dangerous thing do you mean to tell me that at the moment this country&#x27;s without a fit leader or a deputy leader shh not so loud but come good news sir it&#x27;s a yes from eisenhower you were right an invitation from the palace has proved impossible for the americans to refuse they&#x27;ve changed his schedule and they&#x27;re going to make it work but that&#x27;s wonderful news don&#x27;t get out bed winston it is wonderful don&#x27;t get out bed darling don&#x27;t get out of bed if ike comes here i can be leader again winston that&#x27;s what really matters getting me and ike in the same room so that he and i can do go back to bed get on with building a real and lasting peace with the russians look why don&#x27;t you admit the truth that you have been fighting for your life and tell the queen winston how serious is it this time it&#x27;s impossible to know i fear we do now have to put off the americans yes of course and tell the queen no no we&#x27;re in too deep now for that if eisenhower isn&#x27;t coming blame it on him not on winston the queen must never know how much we&#x27;ve kept from her prepare for inspection sorry to disturb you ma&#x27;am i&#x27;ve been asked by downing street to inform you first that president eisenhower is no longer able to leave the united states owing to a political crisis at home well that&#x27;s a relief and that the prime minister still hasn&#x27;t shaken off his cold and will not be attending today&#x27;s private audience really goodness that&#x27;s the second consecutive private audience that he&#x27;s missed it&#x27;s most unlike him yes isn&#x27;t it are you all right martin your majesty i&#x27;ve had the opportunity to think about your very kind offer to become your private secretary and i&#x27;m afraid i must decline why in this instance i really do believe you&#x27;ll be better served by michael no you don&#x27;t ma&#x27;am you don&#x27;t think that nor could you ever think that for the very good reason that it&#x27;s not true have you been spoken to by tommy lascelles ma&#x27;am you have and what did he have to say that i should&#x27;ve refused the offer in the room that i obviously have no respect or understanding for palace tradition and protocol and that it must be michael adeane did he now if you&#x27;ll excuse me for a moment martin come oh your majesty look tommy there&#x27;s no pretty way of saying this i would prefer martin and that is your right ma&#x27;am yes and i rather thought so too but it would be a mistake and why is that please there&#x27;s a way of doing things here an order developed over time generations and individuality in the house of windsor any departure from that way of doing things is not to be encouraged it results in catastrophes like the abdication abdicating the throne and choosing my private secretary is hardly comparing like with like i disagree i served your uncle as you know and it&#x27;s in the small things that the rot starts do the wrong thing once it&#x27;s easier to do it again do the individualistic thing once it is easy to do it again now in the case of your uncle it started with wanting to use buckingham palace simply as the office and york house as his home then he stopped attending church decided he wanted to sell sandringham he dismissed courtiers who&#x27;d served under his father in favor of younger sycophantic supplicants of course no one saw the abdication coming then but the ego the willfulness the individualism the rot had set in martin and i have an understanding i don&#x27;t deny it it would make me feel as if i had an ally friend almost in what can sometimes feel like a very well the next in line and the senior of my two deputies and the natural heir is michael your man the right man but as always the final say is with you ma&#x27;am thank you just had the palace on the phone requesting a private audience this afternoon it seems the queen wants to see you sir me what&#x27;s all this about patrick don&#x27;t know sir can&#x27;t you give me a clue mr colville your majesty you asked to see me your majesty yes jock you were my private secretary for two years before martin charteris i was and it was my impression that we always had a good understanding and we were able to speak openly with one another yes of course and trust one another speak plainly when matters of real importance came up and before her majesty says anything else let me just say how sorry i am it&#x27;s been agony i tried to stop them i told them my opinion but they were so insistent we keep it from you after the second one i really was of a mind to let you know the truth second what stroke ma&#x27;am but they insisted again everyone keep it quiet say nothing i see and who was it that was doing the insisting lord salisbury ma&#x27;am and the prime minister himself on the rare occasions he was conscious i see that is what you asked me here to discuss no i asked you here to discuss whether i should take michael adeane for my private secretary rather than martin charteris but what you&#x27;ve just told me is far more important no yes the slippery old so and so&#x27;s it&#x27;s rather worse than slippery wouldn&#x27;t you say somewhat unconstitutional what are you going to do nothing of course that&#x27;s my job do nothing and stay silent at all times is it from memory and forgive me ma&#x27;am it&#x27;s a while since i read bagehot but in circumstances such as these is it not also your duty to act i doubt it i&#x27;d have to check i think you know precisely yes it is but i can&#x27;t just summon the brightest most formidable men in the country and give them a dressing down like children why you are in the right they in the wrong yes but they&#x27;re far more intelligent than i am any confrontation they&#x27;d out debate me out think me and out maneuver me but this isn&#x27;t about education or intelligence this is about integrity and principle ma&#x27;am you say you don&#x27;t have what it takes to do battle with these people you do you were drilled for years in the finer points of our constitution you know it better than me better than all of us you have the only education that matters so what would you have me do summon them and give them a good dressing down like children why would they stand for that because they&#x27;re english male and upper class a good dressing down from nanny is what they most want in life unconventional to the end professor thank you professor i&#x27;m afraid i urgently need something from windsor castle at least i think it&#x27;s at windsor it might be at sandringham or balmoral or it might be here ma&#x27;am lord salisbury please if you wouldn&#x27;t mind prime minister ma&#x27;am it has come to my attention that for a period of time last week my prime minister was incapacitated and the foreign secretary too and that you colluded in keeping that information from me your maj no it is not my job to govern but it is my job to ensure proper governance but how can i do that if my ministers lie and plot and hide the truth from me you have prevented me from doing my duty you have hampered and bamboozled the proper functioning of the crown how could you my own late father valued you greatly he believed the phrase history teaches never trust a cecil deeply unfair perhaps not you may go prime minister please the prime minister your majesty your majesty winston i am just a young woman starting out in public service and i would never presume to give a man so much my senior and who has given this country so much a lecture however you were at my coronation i was and you therefore heard for yourself as i took the solemn oath to govern the people of my realms according to their respective laws and customs now one of those customs is that their elected prime minister should be of reasonably sound body and mind not an outrageous expectation one would&#x27;ve thought no but it seems that you have not been of sound body and mind these past weeks and that you chose to withhold that information from me a decision which feels like a betrayal not just of the covenant of trust between us and the institutions that we both represent but of our own personal relationship in there are two elements the efficient and the dignified the monarch is the dignified and the government the efficient these two institutions only work when they support each other when they trust one another your actions your breaking of that trust was irresponsible and it might have had serious ramifications for the security of this country is your health better now it is good but is it sufficiently better fit for office better i would ask you to consider your response in light of the respect that my rank and my office deserve not that which my age and gender might suggest ma&#x27;am i look at you now and i realize that the time is fast approaching for me to step down not because i am unwell or unfit for office but because you are ready and therefore i have discharged my duty to your father with your blessing and your forgiveness i shall continue to serve as the leader of your majesty&#x27;s government your majesty hello hello where have you been oh charity cricket match for the national playing fields association spent some time at the airfield doing some rolls no cabinet approval don&#x27;t tell anyone what are you dressed for haven&#x27;t you heard we&#x27;ve a state banquet this evening haven&#x27;t you heard it&#x27;s been cancelled oh christ why doesn&#x27;t anybody tell me anything well perhaps if you were here more i&#x27;ve read two books on eisenhower especially have you really no you look nice do i something&#x27;s different what i don&#x27;t know you seem i advise you to choose your next words very carefully taller somehow or is it just that i&#x27;ve shrunk there&#x27;s nothing shrunken about you dearest where are you going i&#x27;ve got an appointment with my new private secretary oh god tell him to bugger off i can&#x27;t do that and do what instead either i get some stilts so i can reach the heights of my new tall woman or or she could get on her knees major adeane her majesty requests that your appointment might wait i see until tomorrow right&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;265&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;Crown, The S01E08 - Pride &amp;amp; Joy.en.SDH&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;B2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;girls it&#x27;s too soon i can&#x27;t do it i&#x27;m not strong enough that&#x27;s why you have two grown up daughters to step in for you in situations like this i&#x27;ll do it thank you but that makes no sense the speech is for papa about papa i would like to do it it&#x27;s right i do it you don&#x27;t enjoy public speaking whereas i do and i was pa what favorite are you going to deny it your father didn&#x27;t have a favorite he adored you both did so equally as any good father would mummy you decide then as head of the family but she&#x27;s not head of the family i am and i will make the speech ma&#x27;am thank you thank you six years ago i heard the moving words which my father spoke when he unveiled the statue of king george v i did not think then that in so short a time i should be called to take his place but it is with pride that i unveil this noble statue today ma&#x27;am we have been flagging our concern for some time these latest events internationally merely strengthen our view but sending the queen on this forthcoming tour in the current climate would be to put the sovereign in an unacceptable level of danger what is it you would have the queen do stay at home in the wake of minor incidents prosecuted by an insurgent rabble what kind of signal would that send the crown does not back down if britain had made a habit of backing down the world would already be living under the yoke of fascist tyranny and we wouldn&#x27;t have an empire at all then might i suggest we bypass gibraltar altogether it&#x27;s an approach which i would favor too she&#x27;s not ready for something on this scale she&#x27;s not yet up to it especially with so many of our dominions demanding independence we must be considerate of her patronize her no that&#x27;s not what i&#x27;m saying sir yes it is bermuda jamaica australia ceylon uganda it&#x27;s going to be hot your majesty to that end we&#x27;ve been working a great deal with organza crepe de chine and shantung silk we also wanted to feature something particular to each location so we thought sprigs of native wild flowers indigenous to each country that you&#x27;re visiting so on her majesty&#x27;s arrival in sydney we propose a white organza dress scattered with pale yellow wattle blossom how many dresses are there one hundred one hundred and hats thirty six pairs of shoes fifty isn&#x27;t this all a bit much couldn&#x27;t we try to economize it is it was a directive from the government itself from the very top of the government to put our best foot forward for great britain our very best foot it is an absurd pantomime the whole thing i don&#x27;t know why anyone can&#x27;t see beyond it actually i thought the old ostrich feathers rather suited you you should wear those more often up straight please years ago britain had influence and control over one fifth of the world&#x27;s population you look where we are now in india pakistan south africa iraq jordan burma all independent but nobody wants to face it or deal with it so they send us out on the commonwealth roadshow like giving a lick of paint to a rusty old banger to make everyone think it&#x27;s all still fine but it&#x27;s not the rust has eaten away at the engine and the structure the banger is falling apart but no one wants to see it that&#x27;s our job that&#x27;s who we are the coat of paint if the costumes are grand enough if the tiara&#x27;s sparkly enough if the titles are preposterous enough the mythology incomprehensible enough then all must still be fine are we nearly finished yet not quite sir four hours we&#x27;ve been here already for a costume fitting uniform sir not costume you wear uniforms to battle this is a costume fitting it&#x27;s just a formality your majesty confirming your temporary assumption of duties as councilor of state while her majesty is abroad you are so kind to still look after me from your retirement how much is still in the diary well i went through it with major adeane and we tried to throw out as much as we could but there will still be the usual privy council meetings of course some investitures and military inspections couldn&#x27;t we give some of it to princess margaret i&#x27;m just thinking she&#x27;s had a tough time of it lately being allowed to shine a bit might be good for her get her back on track besides i had rather hoped to disappear up to scotland for a while and margaret could deputize for me the office is tucked away in a remote part of the embassy where no one will see me so what do you do all day oh nothing they can&#x27;t keep you there and give you nothing to do i beg to differ nothing is all i do are you at least alone in the office oh no sergeant hewitt is here he&#x27;s just walked in can he hear you oh yes does he watch you oh yes is that the point of sergeant hewitt it is the only point oh god how awful well it&#x27;s not forever feels like it though two years without you to protect me guide me i feel quite unanchored without you yes but it&#x27;s what we agreed to do to help your sister then we shall be free well that&#x27;s it that&#x27;s me off see you when you&#x27;re back from the tour in weeks well call me if you need anything yes you won&#x27;t of course you don&#x27;t need me anymore at all yes of course i do no you don&#x27;t neither of you does i have two grown up daughters quite capable of looking after themselves now who is it that you&#x27;re staying with the vyners up in caithness at the northern gate dunnett head goodness that&#x27;s the end of the earth yes a chance to really get away from it all have a good think about what everything well don&#x27;t think too much or too deeply it just gets one in a muddle oh by the way i&#x27;ve arranged for margaret to deputize for me while i&#x27;m gone as head of state why well someone needs to do it can&#x27;t have people turning up for knighthoods and some civil servant handing them out well if you think she&#x27;s up to it up to what standing still looking pretty and putting a sword on a few people&#x27;s shoulders and making speeches which will be written for her and turning up on time there are people who will get her where she needs to be and behaving herself she will be fine and you if you&#x27;ll allow me for just one moment please you need to give margaret some room some space in which to shine she needs to shine that one and as elder sister you ought to be confident and generous enough to respect that i am are you on your knees is that absolutely necessary course i want to be sure i know what i&#x27;m doing before you go all right i hope you have a steady hand you seem uncharacteristically jumpy guilty conscience perhaps why should i have a guilty conscience have a think if you mean peter and his posting banishment that wasn&#x27;t my doing i was simply acting on the government&#x27;s advice the idea came from your henchman now that&#x27;s a little firm was it yes and it&#x27;s the flat edge remember oh sorry so how is he peter he&#x27;s getting on with it uncomplainingly because that&#x27;s what strong men do but it&#x27;s a lonely existence in brussels no real job stuck in a small flat followed by photographers having to steer clear of all the parties steer clear of all the traps what traps traps being set for him those who would wish to lead him astray catch him in a compromising position those who would cheer the dissolution of our friendship margaret you&#x27;re imagining things am i yes and anyway it&#x27;s not for much longer two years yes but the first three or four months will fly by while you&#x27;re kindly filling in for me i&#x27;ll try not to upstage you how kind i can&#x27;t promise i won&#x27;t bring my own character to it well i never expected anything less that&#x27;s the advantage of having a character to bring too much character an excess of character now look at me and tell me you didn&#x27;t say that without a little bit of envy just remember who you&#x27;re standing in for when i&#x27;m gone my characterless sister your queen not a showgirl were introduced to the people of bermuda for the very first time the royal couple then flies to jamaica the last time you departed on this tour it was cruelly cut short by the death of your dear father in his final months the king told me many times that he could feel it all slipping away the empire our place in the world he saw this tour as a chance to keep each dominion close preserving that empire so take him with you in spirit let his let his example guide you his thoughts influence you i will and if i may never let them see the real elizabeth windsor the cameras the television never let them see that carrying the crown is often a burden let them look at you but let them see only the eternal thank you winston your majesty well done you made it if it was easy to come here everybody would thank god it isn&#x27;t and they don&#x27;t will you want a rest certainly not i&#x27;ve been sitting for hours i want a nice long walk or better still a ride go on go oh scotland the beauty i&#x27;d almost forgotten what it feels like to have the spirits lifted well you&#x27;re welcome to stay any time to get away from it all you&#x27;d soon grow sick of me you know what they say guests and fish or you could become a neighbor there&#x27;s a castle along the coast for sale they&#x27;re threatening to tear it down the owner can&#x27;t afford to keep it up oh chap called imbert terry strange fellow rumor is that on occasion he sings to the seals that swim past the castle oh how queer has it been very difficult it has i don&#x27;t want to sound self piteous but loss has followed loss first and foremost the loss of a husband then the loss of a home having to leave the palace the loss of motherhood as daughters become adults loss of a routine a sense of purpose the loss of a crown imagine years&#x27; experience as queen and being the head of the family bertie was a wonderful husband and father but he needed a great deal of help as king and then we lose him and at precisely the moment when they should be giving me more to do stop me falling into despair they take it all aw they take it all away they put it all into the hands of a girl who&#x27;s totally unequipped for it i&#x27;m so sorry so sorry bermuda will always have a distinguished position within the british commonwealth a position which will i trust remain unshaken by the storms through which the world is passing my husband and i have been deeply touched by the welcome we have received here bermuda holds and will always hold a warm place in our hearts may god bless you all i thought that went well ma&#x27;am message delivered loud and clear i&#x27;d say stay loyal or die is that it now can we knock off i&#x27;m afraid not sir without wishing to rush you ma&#x27;am we do need to move on as quickly as possible yes of course your majesty so sorry ma&#x27;am i really can&#x27;t manage any faster please don&#x27;t worry ready for you ma&#x27;am give her a chance it&#x27;s like being in the navy again eight minutes not nine not seven then to the next location where you&#x27;ll make a speech to ex servicemen at the royal yacht club then by ferry to visit a school near mangrove bay on the west of the island then you will host a garden party here at the governor&#x27;s house for a thousand or so guests where we&#x27;re hoping to find a moment for the ceremonial planting of a tree will we find a moment during any of this to use the lavatory i do hope tomorrow&#x27;s better i&#x27;m afraid not sir up at for a am flight to jamaica here we go again waving like lunatics oh god with any luck one day they&#x27;ll all own television sets and they won&#x27;t come out like this again ma&#x27;am sir just before we take off i thought i might go through the itinerary for our first day in jamaica goody yes do sit down michael thank you we arrive at noon to be greeted by the governor and representatives of the west indian islands a guard of honor will be formed by the jamaican constabulary this is the picture we shall never forget in jamaica the lovely lady and the tall handsome figure of the sailor her husband so near to all the children that they can almost be touched so graceful and so near colonel charteris thought you might like to see the speech for tomorrow night ma&#x27;am give you a chance to prepare thank you oh dear would you bring me a pencil please ma&#x27;am and ask colonel charteris if he&#x27;d be so kind as to come and see me in the morning from all over the west indies people have come here today for this ceremony expressing their loyalty to her good morning sir good morning knocking come in martin your royal highness the speech for the ambassador&#x27;s reception tonight yes ma&#x27;am this was written for my sister very well written thank you manifestly for her in her register reflecting her character if that&#x27;s the right word as we both know i have a different character indeed and since i shall be deputizing for my sister tonight i was wondering if i might make one or two minor adjustments to the text ma&#x27;am give it a bit more color make it feel a bit more like me and breathe a little life into it i&#x27;m sure her royal highness appreciates there&#x27;ll be important people at the reception tonight different backgrounds different sensibilities the speech has been carefully calibrated to avoid giving offence and i&#x27;d suggest to avoid entertaining too it&#x27;s not the sovereign&#x27;s place to entertain and i&#x27;m not the sovereign i understand that but you will be there in her place what about the state diadem tiara or the cambridge lovers&#x27; knot those are her majesty&#x27;s and for state occasions her majesty won&#x27;t mind besides are people not coming tonight expecting to meet a queen yes shouldn&#x27;t we be giving them one your excellencies i am delighted to be here tonight deputizing for my sister the queen who is fortunate enough to be on her travels somewhere between bermuda jamaica and fiji distracted no doubt by waving fields of sugar cane and graceful palms by deep blue water beyond white coral sands by dramatic green hills thick with vegetation and the subtle rhythms of dancing and singing but more vivid more brilliant even than the colors of those lovely islands or the echoes of that music or the welcome of cheerful and friendly people wherever my sister may travel is what i see as i look out from this stage tonight as i look out at all of you tonight my don&#x27;t you all look wonderful and shimmering and positively exotic and what fine company we have here tonight our ambassador to the united states of america sir roger makins the only honest thing to come out of washington our dashing ambassador alec kirkbride in libya this one&#x27;s single ladies oh and of course sir charles peake and his wife from greece a country which has brought us many things philosophy democracy my brother in law so to all of you i say welcome as a rule the food here is pretty ordinary the wine is usually rather good and i have made sure there is plenty of it so i have no doubt we will have a wonderful evening thank you it felt so good my sister talks all the time of how she isn&#x27;t suited to it well i was born for it i know i told them to put as many engagements in the diary as they like for the next few months investitures the royal ballet the debutantes ball well why not oh couldn&#x27;t you come and watch me in action just once if i thought it were without risk i would in a flash but if the papers get hold darling the papers love us the people are for us hm in their eyes we can do no wrong there will be no sleeping sir there&#x27;s a civic hall to visit not to mention the ribbons to be cut and oh the lunches to be consumed ready no almost you go ahead just give me a moment please gents i&#x27;ll be right with you okay thank you right what&#x27;s the matter there was an ambassadors&#x27; reception in london last week apparently margaret was dazzling and brilliant would you have preferred she make a mess of it no perhaps is that awful of me yes well now you know you didn&#x27;t marry a saint i knew that but i wouldn&#x27;t worry i have great faith in her in margaret in her ability to mess things up in the long run or outshine me and mess things up and outshine me that&#x27;s unlike you i&#x27;m sorry you know there is a danger we might be overdoing it perhaps it would be prudent to take a few things out i mean australian towns in days maybe we don&#x27;t visit all of them no no we keep every appointment no cancellations not one i&#x27;m afraid the day does hold some challenges ma&#x27;am the route&#x27;s ten miles and the streets are already packed well how long will it take i&#x27;ve allowed two hours two hours in a hundred degree heat i could ask them to increase the planned driving speed a little but i think the horses might struggle no we&#x27;ll be fine thank you here she is at last amongst us charming our people in city after city afternoon in sydney first then good hearted adelaide on to venerable hobart nestling at the cool feet of mount wellington that&#x27;s it the castle of mey isn&#x27;t she bonny oh yes and what a view captain imbert terry commander vyner lady doris and we&#x27;ve met i don&#x27;t think so yes yes yes youryour face it&#x27;s very familiar don&#x27;t say a thing it&#x27;ll come to me may we come in yes yes imbert well if you were to be interested in the property i&#x27;m going to be entirely honest the roof does need a does need a bit of work one or two windows might need replacing and the the electricity does need well installing and there&#x27;s no dining room to speak of nor bathrooms and i&#x27;ve sold off most of the good shooting and fishing oh dear you&#x27;re really not a salesman in fact the place is in such a state i&#x27;d sooner make a gift of it i&#x27;m afraid i&#x27;d be quite unable to accept why not it&#x27;d be frowned upon something to do with who i am you&#x27;re an actress a famous film star no a singer then no it&#x27;s on the tip of my tongue imbert it dates back to the mid th century it was in the it was in the same family for generations we bought the place in and my wife and i had very happy years here but then the war came and the place the solution is obvious stop smiling no the trouble is i have the sort of face that if i&#x27;m not smiling then everyone says oh isn&#x27;t she cross no that&#x27;s not look what do you think doctor it&#x27;s a spasm the muscles are overworked rest ought to fix it though like i said stop smiling no i have an engagement this evening so what can be done well i could inject the affected area with a relaxant you&#x27;d have to watch yourself with soup though you might find you have less control chewing and drinking and it&#x27;s not a long term solution oh all right i&#x27;ll have the injection oh good god what and dribble soup all over your dress do you know the other night i woke up with my right arm out from under the bedclothes do you know what i&#x27;d been doing i&#x27;d been waving to the crowds in my sleep right hold still please your majesty american planes guns and ammunition are helping the french and vietnam forces russian and chinese weapons are aiding the viet minh princess margaret dons white overalls when she visits calverton colliery in nottinghamshire her visit to the coalface a quarter of a mile underground is included in her tour of the colliery which is recognized as one of the most modern in europe after almost an hour underground the princess brings back a souvenir a piece of coal she hewed herself did you enjoy the mining your royal highness i did very much although it was jolly dusty down there some even went into my mouth but i can assure you it tasted delicious having experienced the conditions do you have sympathy for the miners that work there one couldn&#x27;t fail to have sympathy for anyone who has to spend their working life down there it&#x27;s intolerably dark and hot and cramped to my eyes it seemed conditions are still very perilous for these poor brave men who work underground for so very little what would you say to the authorities regarding the matter i have nothing further to say who&#x27;s the coal for i have someone very special in mind group captain townsend are you missing him yes i am very much and are you missing your sister her majesty the queen not quite as much no why on earth did you say that what that you missed me i did and i do i know but that wasn&#x27;t wise why not darling you can&#x27;t use a public occasion to take a dig at your sister like that oh don&#x27;t you start too it&#x27;s just the palace won&#x27;t like it and we need the palace on our side who is it you think you&#x27;d be letting down anyway a koala this whole thing is a circus it&#x27;s a miserable circus trudging from town to town and we&#x27;re the dancing bears what are you doing i&#x27;m taking back this small pleasure you&#x27;ve taken away too much no no no those things will kill you yeah forty a day your father smoked and now i know why poor bastard yeah he probably took one look at this tour and thought d&#x27;you know what i&#x27;d be better off with cancer shut up what is it you&#x27;re trying to prove what is it you want to hear him say bravo lilibet manage the whole tour lilibet never lets you down ticked every box never put a foot wrong now finally i love you more than i love margaret get out get out don&#x27;t touch me oh christ get out philip don&#x27;t you dare come back here don&#x27;t be ridiculous christ let me go and have a word no i&#x27;ll do it i&#x27;m sorry for that little interlude i&#x27;m sure it must happen in every marriage now what would you like me to do for your newsreel another gift for your majesty thank you your royal highness when you appear in public performing official duties you are not you of course i&#x27;m me expressing political opinions about working conditions in mines that business at sadler&#x27;s wells and no one wants you to be you they want you to be it a statue a thing the crown that&#x27;s what they&#x27;ve come to see not you the minute you become yourself you shatter the illusion break the spell what people want is someone to inhabit it not be frightened of it make it flesh and blood bring it to life your uncle edward viii threatened to do just that impose his individuality on the institution bring it to life and he almost destroyed it in the process you can&#x27;t seriously be comparing this to the abdication no but i&#x27;ve decided that all remaining royal engagements in the queen&#x27;s absence should be carried out by the queen mother my mother is in scotland so i gather but i sent someone to bring her back right away your royal highness imbert we said what time is it now well it&#x27;s nearly noon goodness and i set off in such good time did you come along the coast i did you didn&#x27;t factor in the wind you were into the wind this morning wasn&#x27;t i just the good news is you&#x27;ll fly back now i&#x27;ve um i&#x27;ve had a chance to do some thinking i&#x27;ve spoken to my lawyers and i&#x27;ve come up with a sum that i think is a fair price for this magnificently situated castle yes yes go on brace yourself one hundred pounds what oh i&#x27;m sorry is that too dear no it&#x27;s absurd on the contrary it&#x27;s entirely fair given it&#x27;ll end up costing you tens of thousands are you sure no the question is are you sure i am all right congratulations i hope you&#x27;ll be very happy here thank you i have a feeling i will be i can get the place cleared out inside a week oh only if you&#x27;ve somewhere to go i do my sister&#x27;s a few miles down the coast now will i walk you back to the vyners down wind that&#x27;d be lovely your majesty forgive me for disturbing you i come from the prime minister he asks that you return to london immediately whatever for this is all the information that i have it seems i must go oh my gosh it&#x27;s finally come to you why on earth didn&#x27;t you say ma&#x27;am because people always make such a fuss and stop being themselves and you would have doubled the price spoken like a true scotswoman now my speech at valletta there was one adjustment that i would like to make i would like to refer to malta as my island of happy memories very good ma&#x27;am i shall have the text retyped for your approval thank you ma&#x27;am there do remain some security concerns about gibraltar what concerns death threats were sent to all the leaders of the major political parties telling them that if our tour were to go to gibraltar our safety can&#x27;t be guaranteed i told them we should pull out why what do you mean why because i don&#x27;t much fancy shuffling the streets of gibraltar like a sitting duck no pulling out at this late hour would make us look weak and it would be a great disappointment to the people of gibraltar i say we go i say we don&#x27;t i am aware that i am surrounded by people who feel that they could do the job better strong people with powerful characters more natural leaders perhaps better suited to leading from the front making a mark but for better or worse the crown has landed on my head and i say we go the royal yacht britannia sails towards gibraltar visible on deck her majesty the queen and the duke of edinburgh accompanying britannia a class destroyers from the mediterranean fleet shoot with a gun salute a powerful signal to the people of gibraltar of the queen and the british empire&#x27;s enduring support magnificent tour has already marked her majesty as a woman of destiny her return to london after miles by air land and sea is a triumph of diplomacy at a challenging time for the empire not a single item of the enormous list of engagements has been missed millions have seen and greeted their queen as she leaves the commonwealth charmed and united it is already clear that her majesty will occupy a place among the famous queens of history and promises a renewed role for britain in the modern world the empire secure across the four corners of the earth marking the start of a new elizabethan age hello your majesty aha yes ma&#x27;am prime minister&#x27;s arrived ready go thank you i&#x27;m fast daddy i&#x27;m going to get you no no no chair chair mind the dogs you can&#x27;t get away from me the prime minister your majesty congratulations your majesty thank you winston an unqualified triumph a narrow escape i say it could so easily have gone the other way but it didn&#x27;t and has put us right back where we belong higher in fact and before the tour our great nation was in danger of losing much of its status our influence our standing your courage and conviction prevailed this time perhaps but in time they will surely grow tired of it grow tired of us only if the crown and the people representing the crown make mistakes errors of judgement my dear sister yes what would you have me do thank you ma&#x27;am your majesty her royal highness is on her way thank you it&#x27;s all right i have been here before i do know the way what in there yes ma&#x27;am goodness what have i done to deserve this the brief was simple perform minor ceremonial tasks with a minimum of fuss not end up all over the newspapers i can&#x27;t help it if they want to write about me well it would help if you didn&#x27;t give them what they crave character and excitement instability and drama well at least i give them something you give them nothing i give them silence silence is nothing it&#x27;s the absence of noise emptiness blank page which allows others to shine but the monarchy should shine the monarchy yes not the monarch reparations will need to be made to whom to the people you offended a general to whom when asked if you&#x27;d like to dance you replied yes but not with you i believe there was also a debutante you managed to make cry and the dancers of sadler&#x27;s wells whom you refused to meet after arriving late for the performance you showed individuality and that made people panic they don&#x27;t want individuality the last person who showed character almost took the ship down you are enjoying this not a bit yes you are admonishing your unruly young sister have you ever thought how it must be for me many times at great length wistfully you have a role a clear set of rules all you have to do is follow them margaret you have freedom all you have to do is enjoy it you think that i am free to be constantly in your shadow constantly the overlooked one it looks like heaven to me what you have looks like heaven to me two sisters who envy one another we wouldn&#x27;t be the first pride and joy remember what papa called us yes elizabeth is my pride and margaret is my joy but margaret is my joy i&#x27;m sorry i have to claim the few victories i&#x27;m left with and we&#x27;re not disputing it surely what that i was papa&#x27;s favorite there&#x27;s a cruel truth to it isn&#x27;t there when there are two sisters so close in age the more one becomes one thing the more the other necessarily becomes the opposite and vice versa it&#x27;s the way of things if one is the queen must be the source of honor and all that is good the other necessarily becomes the focus of the most creative malice evil sister no one says you&#x27;re evil next to you i will always be evil feckless lost lesser thing and yet you spend so much time telling me that i&#x27;m a lesser thing only to give myself a moment&#x27;s peace would you consider doing it for me just from time to time what putting a foot wrong the occasional mistake let the side down so i might not be so conspicuous a failure by comparison you&#x27;re tired no i&#x27;m not not tired i&#x27;m just asking for a future i can bear margaret do i have your word that those apologies will be made we can help you draft letters or make statements no need&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;266&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;Crown, The S01E09 - Assassins.en.SDH&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;B2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;sends a letter of goodbye it&#x27;s no secret you feel better if you cry lord porchester this way madam at the end of the bar hello hello porchey you found the place all right the taxi driver did yes of course wonderful lord porchester ladies is it just me or is this place faintly ridiculous two of my great hates in life fine dining and central london i just thought it&#x27;s the kind of special occasion place one came if one had a special question to ask at this moment i wish i were a poet not a horse breeder will you marry me oh porchey that sounds like a no no it&#x27;s not a no no no no no no no no no no no no no that&#x27;s no&#x27;s i would love to on one condition that you don&#x27;t still hold a torch for her who oh her i know how close you were and how close your families still are it&#x27;s true she and i we are close i was close to her father i am close to her sister our families are close in many ways and i speak as a breeder myself it would have been a good match perfect match i won&#x27;t deny it vehicle approaching except for the fact it was never on the cards for her there was only ever philip and for you there&#x27;s only you lilibet right you are jock yes i&#x27;ll let him know thank you i&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll be delighted bye are you winning no there was one brief tantalizing moment when i thought i had it i moved in for the kill but then one wrong brushstroke and it got away once again i&#x27;ve just been talking to jock about your th birthday no don&#x27;t mention it because it happens on the same day as the opening of parliament they&#x27;ve decided to combine events and hold a reception in your honor at the great hall oh that&#x27;s very nice oh and it&#x27;s going to be graham sutherland who the painter to paint your portrait what portrait it&#x27;s the official portrait commissioned by both houses it&#x27;s your present sutherland never heard of him he&#x27;s got quite the reputation he&#x27;s a modernist oh not sure i can trust a modernist with an english name give me a german modernist or an italian they&#x27;re the ones who have to start all over again whatever would an englishman want to change it&#x27;s grand to be home again after so long an absence the surgeon who operated on me told me yesterday that all was well i&#x27;ll need to have a further period of convalescence put on some weight but there is nothing else to worry about as i said it&#x27;s grand to be home again i look forward to being back at work just as soon as possible thank you thank you hello porchey i hope i&#x27;m not disturbing goodness am i disturbing no good it&#x27;s aureole i think we&#x27;re making a mistake i think we should lead from the start and i think you&#x27;re wrong but we both know he doesn&#x27;t hold up naturally we tried holding him up against darius before and darius won that was the guineas which is a mile this is the king george a mile and a half what will we do if he plays up before the race he always plays up that&#x27;s who he is you don&#x27;t seem the slightest bit worried anything else well can i just say one more time for the record i think we should start fast and run at a good clip noted i am right sometimes you know even you said yourself that i have good instincts you do and i might well live to regret it that and a good many other things oh dear such as good night mr sutherland prime minister good morning how do you do good morning hello how do you do good morning how do you do sir it&#x27;s an honor no no the honor is mine so where do you want me so will we be engaged in flattery or reality are you going to paint me as a cherub or a bulldog i imagine there are a great number of mr churchills yes indeed there are well as you search for him perhaps i can implore you not to feel the need to be too accurate why accuracy is truth no for accuracy we have the camera painting is the higher art i paint a bit myself you know yes sir i know and i never let accuracy get in the way of truth if i don&#x27;t want it to if i see some landscape i like and i wish there wasn&#x27;t a factory in the background i leave the factory out so mr sutherland tell me i&#x27;m fascinated what is your process first i shall take some photographs they&#x27;ll be useful as reference when i get back to the studio then i shall do some charcoal sketches studies of the head the hands and then i&#x27;ll work those sketches up the actual painting up will be done in my studio at home is this do you mind perfectly all right carry on well what pose are you thinking of seated i could try standing it might be more commanding dynamic it might make me look younger i thought the painting was supposed to celebrate reaching a certain age four score years winston i think seated is more senatorial oh senatorial what nonsense yes i agree cigar or no cigar no cigar garter robes or no garter robes no finery no grandiosity dressed merely as a parliamentarian how prosaic i liked him yes i could tell you were smitten blushing like a little girl well he is rather a wow a wow tall and handsome saturnine a bit of a heathcliff he wants total control well any artist worth anything would insist on that you don&#x27;t really want a flatterer yes i do no you don&#x27;t besides it&#x27;s manifestly clear he&#x27;s a fan oh no don&#x27;t be silly you can smell the socialism on him even the socialists acknowledge you saved the country through gritted teeth i have the protective instincts of a loving wife and i can tell you this one is not an assassin oh whoa whoa whoa whoa look look at this it&#x27;s aureole the queen&#x27;s aureole the queen&#x27;s horse followed by isn&#x27;t he marvelous isn&#x27;t he clever you were absolutely no no he won you were absolutely right he&#x27;s so clever i know i know what a champion what a champion good boy hello i remember getting the phone call from your father when he was born by hyperion and out of angelola yes we gave him his first milk do you remember watching him grow up everyone thought his elder brother would be the star your clever papa always had an instinct for this one he&#x27;s the underdog and he backed him and an underdog became a star yes and his favorite horse so what&#x27;s next for our champion well we have received an invitation to the laurel international america yes next month he&#x27;s what four already at the older end of the spectrum if you were asking my opinion that is why i asked you here today my honest advice i&#x27;d consider retiring him now at the top of his game the best middle distance horse in europe with a sky high market value let him earn you some proper money as a stud i&#x27;m surprised to hear you turning down the opportunity of going to america why well that&#x27;s where your girlfriend&#x27;s from isn&#x27;t it fianc fianc goodness who is she money i hope so you can keep up the stables actually she&#x27;s a portsmouth oh dear so no money some money but horse mad well she&#x27;d have to be you&#x27;d approve i think well can i meet her if you promise you won&#x27;t scare her why would i scare her you&#x27;re the queen only some of the time all the time and that makes you terrifying and she&#x27;s heard a lot about you from whom from me some of it nice too oh the one you let get away what he&#x27;s always carried a torch for you porchey utter nonsense he told me himself one night while in his cups that doesn&#x27;t count when a man&#x27;s had a drink that&#x27;s when the truth comes out no that&#x27;s when the nonsense comes out besides we have interests in common horses aren&#x27;t an interest to you they&#x27;re a passion a passion your husband doesn&#x27;t share he has other passions so i hear sir good morning the foreign secretary is here sir shall i show him in no not here sorry to keep you waiting as apposite as ever i didn&#x27;t mean it like that there&#x27;s ugliness in the air anthony i have nothing of beauty to say then say what you must deposit your ugliness and go i have more important things to do very well at some point every leader must ask himself whether by staying in office he is giving to the country or taking from it helping or harming and i would suggest that for some time now you have been taking and harming and therefore i come to you in the name of the party and of the country for the very last time winston to bid you to stand down i will in good time the right time the right time was nine years ago when you lost us the election and i have since avenged that defeat by winning us the last election i won us that winston i won that people voted conservative in the clear expectation that you would give way to me that is such rubbish they voted conservative because they couldn&#x27;t stomach socialism inflation is out of control and with every misjudgment with every miscalculation with every utterance you make that appetite to return to the left is growing be careful anthony too much excitement is not good for one so soon after an operation spoken by a man who only two months ago was effectively dead which makes two of us i have recovered that&#x27;s not what i hear i hear you are a shadow of your former self that when you walk the pills rattle around inside of you i have something that you will never see again a clean bill of health stalin said the same he died groveling on the floor mr sutherland is here hello anthony anthony was just leaving hello clemmie yes i was just leaving here we are morning morning sir this is my wife kathleen she assists me sometimes i hope you don&#x27;t mind over here what&#x27;s that you&#x27;re using pencil yeah but which kind b or b not sure it&#x27;s a b and on what paper drawing paper i favor heavy weight cotton cold pressed deckle edged sized with gelatin how many paintings does your husband complete in a year mrs sutherland three or four would you care to guess how many i average ten of course i&#x27;m just a hobbyist an enthusiast not a major artist like your husband taking his time over here i did a little reading about you mr sutherland after our last session did you yeah quite interesting from what i read this is all very new to you this portraiture i don&#x27;t think anyone starts out wanting to be a portraitist yeah but in your search for your m tier you&#x27;ve tried a bit of everything that&#x27;s true i came to painting quite late and now that you&#x27;ve found it you&#x27;ll never leave it yes yeah i quite understand how is it mrs sutherland it has truth am i to be allowed a peek no well why not i could give you advice after all i know this face better than you do if you&#x27;ve made the neck too thick or the arms too long i can tell you i find in general people have very little understanding of who they are one has to turn a blind eye to so much of oneself in order to get through life and you see it as your responsibility to bring all that out into the open certainly the good as well as the bad just concentrate on the good and all will be well you&#x27;re not just painting me you know you&#x27;re painting the prime minister of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland and everything that great office represents democracy freedom the highest ideals of government and leadership just remember that yes lord porchester your majesty thank you plug in porchey what a palaver what is getting through to you i picked up the phone to you just after nine this morning it&#x27;s now gone midday oh don&#x27;t exaggerate but yes i know it is infuriating fire away you asked me to come up with some figures for you with regard to aureole although i&#x27;m numerically dyslexic runs in the family i&#x27;m afraid like the high forehead i have done the sums see if this helps you with your decision in the course of his lifetime as a racehorse aureole has made you just over pounds goodness but if you were to put him out to stud he could make you far more he&#x27;s a recognized champion with a top notch pedigree you could stand him at wolferton stud for top dollar well that&#x27;s a decision then good and in the meantime i&#x27;ll ask if i can get you a direct line to you yes to me why was there anyone else you wanted to speak to here no good what is it top dollar i need numbers a pop a shot sorry i&#x27;m trying to find a less onomatopoeic expression for i know what it is a shag a cover a cover yes that&#x27;s the correct term for a horse hump yes so what might you earn then over the course of the year well in one year alone aureole might cover mares making about pounds good for him in the course of his lifetime at the stud he might sire foals making me over pounds creating an entire generation of offspring yes father to all the foals in our stables and any other stable that could afford him yes oh i see so in time every horse out there could somehow be related to aureole yes i suppose so like old man carnarvon who your friend porchey&#x27;s father porchey no like i said his father yes they&#x27;re both called porchey wasn&#x27;t that the rumor what rumor well that he&#x27;d had so many affairs an entire generation of british aristocrats was related to him an illegitimate porchey in every great house in the land high foreheads everywhere and numerical dyslexia what nothing what nothing michael dear boy good night good night let me have a look at you marvelous shall we come on you look beautiful how is he not too bad sir this way morning morning no wife this time no i asked her not to come since this is to be our final session i wanted us to be all alone in silence preferably yes yes i&#x27;ll be a good boy i quite understand the need for concentration painting a picture is like fighting a battle a bloody battle in the gladiatorial fight to the death the artist either wins or loses are you winning i hope so do you think i&#x27;ll like it i think that&#x27;s possibly too much to ask for but i do take comfort from the fact that your own work is so honest and revealing oh thank you for the compliment well are there any works that you&#x27;re referring to in particular i was thinking especially of the goldfish pond here at chartwell the pond why the pond it&#x27;s just a pond it&#x27;s very much more than that as borne out by the fact that you&#x27;ve returned to it again and again more than times well yes because it&#x27;s such a technical challenge it eludes me well perhaps you elude yourself sir that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s more revealing than a self portrait oh that&#x27;s nonsense it&#x27;s the water the play of light the trickery the fish down below i think all our work is unintentionally revealing and i find it especially so with your pond beneath the tranquility and the elegance and the light playing on the surface i saw honesty and pain terrible pain the framing itself indicated to me that you wanted us to see something beneath all the muted colors deep down in the water terrible despair hiding like a leviathan like a sea monster you saw all that yes i did perhaps that says more about you than me mm hmm perhaps may i ask you a question mr sutherland hmm it&#x27;s about one of your paintings the one you call pastoral with all that gnarled and twisted wood those great ugly dabs of black i found something malevolent in it where did that come from well that&#x27;s very perceptive that was a very dark time my my son john passed away aged two months oh my i am sorry yes thank you you have five yes four marigold was the fifth she left us at age two years nine months septicemia i&#x27;m so sorry i had no idea we settled on the name marigold on account of her wonderful golden curls the most extraordinary color regretfully but though perhaps mercifully i was not present when she died when i came home clemmie roared like a wounded animal we bought chartwell a year after marigold died that was when i put in the the pond here thank you well thank you it was a pleasure i look forward to seeing it hello hello shall we yes given this is aureole&#x27;s debut and we want to leave nothing to chance i&#x27;ve called up three different mares very rarely does a forced tryst make a fruitful tryst if one wants the perfect foal one needs to be prepared to wait for the perfect pairing shall we meet neocracy oh the aga khan&#x27;s horse indeed yes recently retired with a good record as a winner lovely temperament too my only concern would be is she perhaps a little too bashful i&#x27;m worried that if we left these two to it nothing would ever happen which is why i&#x27;ve also called up turkish blood an altogether different proposition indeed strong willful with a terrific track record herself it really would be breeding the best with the best i&#x27;m sensing a but from memory your aureole is something of a sensitive soul i&#x27;d hate him to be intimidated or come unstuck when faced with a fiery warrior like this very considerate of you porchey which is why i have a good feeling about our third candidate feast your eyes on temple bar a hot thoroughbred with a winning streak herself she&#x27;s a little on the young side perhaps just three we don&#x27;t mind that do we immediate engagement yes i must say i do like this one it would appear the feeling is mutual you&#x27;re lovely telegrams have been pouring into downing street today to wish sir winston churchill a happy th birthday on this the th of november they come from all clementine hums happy birthday happy birthday my darling old pug happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday dear prime minister happy birthday to you for he&#x27;s a jolly good fellow for he&#x27;s a jolly good fellow for he&#x27;s a jolly good fellow and so say all of us oh is it time it is ma&#x27;am right do sit down michael thank you ma&#x27;am westminster hall silent witness of nearly a thousand years of history was the scene of the birthday presentations to sir winston i am deeply honored to be here today no politician has ever received such an honor before and i am deeply grateful i am aware however that after having served my country for of my years resignation is a word that hangs in the air and indeed it is the perfect occasion for it and the stage is set and the audience is assembled all ready for a grand valediction there&#x27;s only one problem the lead actor has forgotten his lines and instead of standing down he is taking an encore oh dear he&#x27;s playing with them all when your political colleagues are kind enough to present you with a portrait by an ambitious modernist one has to ask oneself is it a gift or is it a curse mr sutherland the artist and i spoke a great deal during my sittings i reminded him of the stakes involved that his portrait was not just of me but of the office i represent indeed of our entire system of government so at long last i look forward to unveiling this painting gasping a fine patriotic piece of modern art laughter why are you here i understand you&#x27;ve rejected the painting i have on what grounds that is not a painting it&#x27;s a humiliation how shall i paint him today ah sitting on a chair producing a stool a broken sagging pitiful creature squeezing and squeezing that&#x27;s not how it&#x27;s being seen that is how it is and i will not accept it i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s wise to reject it it was commissioned by the members of the joint houses of parliament as a sign of respect well then they should have commissioned an artist who is respectful instead of a judas wielding his murderous brush look at it it is a betrayal of friendship and an unpatriotic treacherous cowardly assault by the individualistic left as regards the friendship clearly there is none i accepted this commission because i admired you and i came through the experience admiring you even more you make monsters of everyone you admire it&#x27;s not vindictive it&#x27;s art it&#x27;s not personal well you are a lost soul a narcissist without direction or certainty please sir don&#x27;t overreact give it time i showed those sketches to your wife throughout she remarked on how accurate they were that is the whole point it is not a reasonably truthful image of me it is sir it is not it is cruel age is cruel if you see decay it&#x27;s because there&#x27;s decay if you see frailty it&#x27;s because there&#x27;s frailty i can&#x27;t be blamed for what is and i refuse to hide and disguise what i see if you&#x27;re engaged in a fight with something then it&#x27;s not with me it&#x27;s with your own blindness i think you should go car door slams he&#x27;s right what i am that man in the painting wretched and decaying i cannot go on you&#x27;ve said that before this time i mean it i&#x27;m tired you&#x27;ve had enough i have my love this time i really have good of course i knew it was coming and if i&#x27;m being frank there were one or two moments when i might have even hoped for it too prayed no doubt you really have been the most remarkable servant to your country thank you ma&#x27;am no winston on behalf of us all thank you and you wish for mr eden to take over i do well that will make him happy for a day or two he might even stop cursing me then he will be overwhelmed by a job in which no man can ever succeed and curse me again for leaving it to him it might be an idea not to tell him that before he starts no ma&#x27;am so this is our last audience yes however will i cope without you you will be fine ma&#x27;am i have nothing more to teach you which is why it&#x27;s time for me to leave your majesty stop renaming london airport i want something more personal for winston what about dinner here or buckingham palace no there downing street yes it would be quite the compliment you and philip go there for dinner i&#x27;ll ask philip no you&#x27;ll tell philip mummy dinner downing street oh god why not is she a looker do you think i mean if i were a stallion would i fancy her attraction isn&#x27;t so much about looks as smell oh i see well does she smell good well we&#x27;ll see won&#x27;t we come on come on rather like us darling when we were courting gently gently come on shh will you please be quiet yeah look there we go all right all right hold her steady steady oi oi i&#x27;ll say back off yes there we go good girl good boy is that it guineas for that as long as he&#x27;s done what he needs to do and it bears fruit i don&#x27;t mind well done porchey yes indeed well done porchey i hear he&#x27;s been given a direct line who porchey so he can call straight in i know only because i tried to get one for mike and was refused yes on account of him not being a family member porchey is like family is he yes part of the furniture well as long as you don&#x27;t sit on him anytime soon well that all seemed to go well yes it did didn&#x27;t it are you all right mm can you leave us now please yes ma&#x27;am i have nothing to hide from you nothing porchey is a friend and yes there are those who would have preferred me to marry him indeed marriage with him might have been easier might have even worked better than ours but to everyone&#x27;s regret and frustration the only person i have ever loved is you and can you honestly look me in the eye and say the same can you pray silence for her majesty the queen my lords ladies and gentlemen dear winston and lady churchill my confidence in sir anthony is complete and i know he will lead the country on to great achievements but it would be useless to pretend that either he or any of those successors who may one day follow him in office will ever for me be able to hold the place of my first prime minister to whom my husband and i owe so much and for whose wise guidance during the early years of my reign i shall always be so profoundly grateful hear hear i will remember you always for your magnanimity your courage at all times and for your unfailing humor founded in your unrivalled mastery of the english language i take comfort from the fact that in losing my constitutional adviser i gain a wise counsellor to whom i shall look for help and support in the days which lie ahead may there be many of them hear hear&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;267&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;Crown, The S01E10 - Gloriana.en.SDH&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;B2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;darling a bit smoother and then very very close together knocking the duke and duchess of york your majesty i won&#x27;t see her just my brother i gather you&#x27;ve made your decision i have i&#x27;m afraid you won&#x27;t thank me for it is she really worth it i love her with all my heart of course but more than your own country hmm more than your own family more than your own brother yes you&#x27;ll be fine you have a wife by your side and heirs to spare my daughters this will crush them if you stand down i shall want you and that woman gone for good brother has indeed turned against brother pay me to brother and i&#x27;ll be gone forever a sailor went to sea sea sea to see what he could see see see but all that he could see see see was the bottom of the deep blue sea sea sea a sailor went to me me me to see what he could me me me ms mcdonald his majesty has asked to see the two princesses ms right come along girls lilibet margaret your uncle has let us all down he put love before family now i want you to promise me one thing that you will never put anyone or anything before one another you are sisters above all else and must never let one another down understood never never happy birthday margaret thank you so i&#x27;ve done what you all asked and waited two years but now that i am and free to decide for myself whom i will marry it is with great pleasure thank you great pleasure and pride that i say i am still committed to peter i&#x27;ve kept my side of the bargain now i&#x27;m hoping you&#x27;ll keep yours of course happy birthday thank you afternoon ma&#x27;am yes thank you michael one or two bits and pieces a request from our neighbor captain farquharson wanting to lease a few acres of balmoral grouse land in exchange for the acres which we leased from him last year now i spoke to the head keeper and he advised checking nest stocks before responding yes that seems very sensible and a card from the mayor of easter ross whose th it is this year yes he&#x27;s not been well has he a stroke earlier in the year but he&#x27;ll mend now i&#x27;m happy to say good that&#x27;s everything from me ma&#x27;am anything from you yes an instruction to put things in motion as regards group captain townsend&#x27;s return to the country ma&#x27;am as you know my sister is now free from the constraints of the royal marriages act and no longer requires my consent to marry yes what is it that you&#x27;re not saying michael well there is still the other hurdle the second part of the royal marriages act the fact that her royal highness has turned merely means that she has reached an age where she can give notice of her intention to marry not that she is free to marry what well if both houses of parliament approve only then after months have expired can the marriage take place and any marriage contracted in defiance of these rules would be void why did no one tell me this at the time to which i hope you replied it&#x27;s always been there ma&#x27;am in black and white yes but no one drew my attention to it or said anything this is going to be very difficult i&#x27;m sorry i do feel that we&#x27;ve left her in a difficult spot t he queen mother always believed that two years&#x27; separation would be long enough for princess margaret to lose interest in the group captain and the whole thing to go away but she hasn&#x27;t and it hasn&#x27;t and if anything the queen&#x27;s dilemma at the heart of it all is only more acute either she puts her foot down and forbids the marriage that turns sister against sister and splits the royal house down the middle or she permits the marriage setting a collision course with the church of which she herself is the head well let me give it some more thought we&#x27;ll speak in the morning good night michael thank you sir take a worm what a worm with your fingers go on they won&#x27;t bite they&#x27;re worms boy that&#x27;s it good boy it&#x27;s wriggling of course it&#x27;s wriggling it&#x27;s a worm it&#x27;ll stop wriggling once you put it on the hook so i was thinking about a week on monday what for to make the announcement the engagement would you mind holding off just a moment longer everything&#x27;s fine don&#x27;t worry there&#x27;s just been a slight wrinkle what&#x27;s a wrinkle oh no a formality which no one told me about it will take a little longer than expected well how much longer we&#x27;ve waited two years already i understand and peter&#x27;s been through hell i know waiting like a martyr locking himself away i know seeing no one speaking to no one i&#x27;ve been crying into my pillow at night counting the days why why because we were doing you a favor i&#x27;m aware of that to spare you your blushes to make your life easier i know and i&#x27;m going to take care of it look i probably shouldn&#x27;t have said a thing we&#x27;re going to go up in three ok one two three cast come on let&#x27;s try again hold this please i&#x27;m trying yeah well try harder it&#x27;s difficult daddy no it&#x27;s not difficult come on if you don&#x27;t try again you&#x27;ll never catch a fish he dominates that poor boy he can be very kind too watch what i do and he&#x27;s wonderful with anne and here then back to here and cast i still think he&#x27;s too hard on him taking out his own frustrations on an innocent child i had lunch with tommy lascelles last week and we both agreed that philip still hasn&#x27;t settled and struggles with life in your shadow come on charles let&#x27;s do this let&#x27;s have another go tommy came up with an interesting notion hey there you go mummy i caught one well done have you noticed something about our children they&#x27;re the wrong way round what well our daughter&#x27;s a boy and our son is god bless him a girl don&#x27;t be silly he&#x27;s just sensitive have you seen him fish a girl what&#x27;s the matter you seem preoccupied i am i&#x27;ve got problems with margaret and mummy&#x27;s been interfering surprise surprise along with everything else would you hate the idea of going to australia what for to open the olympic games the olympics are in november aren&#x27;t they you can&#x27;t go in november oh no i didn&#x27;t mean with me i meant alone in my name right whose idea was that does it matter would you agree to it no i&#x27;d be gone months weeks away from you away from the children yes but would you do it no oh please everyone just wants you to be happy nobody gives a fig about my happiness yes they do they want you to be stable and fulfilled everybody wants you happy stable and fulfilled they wish i&#x27;d just disappear no they just think you&#x27;d benefit from the attention and preferably never come back no just come back what what say it say it a different man no not that what then say it pick the adjective all right yes changed princess margaret third in line for the throne of britain now and legally in control of her own destiny pressmen and sightseers throng the lanes undeterred by the official statement that no announcement is contemplated at present about the princess&#x27; future meanwhile the new prime minister fresh off the plane from cairo travels to scotland to brief the queen on the latest development with colonel nasser mr eden have you come to discuss princess margaret&#x27;s marriage margaret oh hello where are you going prime minister&#x27;s just arrived taking to my bed i intend to remain in sulk for at least a week oh dear don&#x27;t tell me my wife yes your tie thank you it&#x27;s not easy i&#x27;m a little fed up with her myself truth be told why what&#x27;s she done to you don&#x27;t get me started is she making life difficult for you and peter yes she wants to delay the engagement well it serves you right quite frankly you both seem far too happy and far too in love do we yes it&#x27;s easy to be in love with someone who&#x27;s not here isn&#x27;t it yes perhaps that&#x27;s why she&#x27;s sending me away chin up thank you thank you would you excuse me the prime minister your majesty yes i&#x27;ve just been reading about your difficulty with colonel nasser have the newspapers exaggerated it terribly to a very significant degree yes oh well you can tell me all about it in the car i thought rather than have our audience in the study we could get some fresh air you must be longing for a walk after your journey do you have any outdoor shoes galoshes ma&#x27;am well you might need something sturdier than that come on she&#x27;s a bit throaty i&#x27;m afraid we&#x27;ve been having trouble with the fuel pump tell me about colonel nasser well the trouble started the minute we landed in cairo i got off the plane and made a statement to local reporters in arabic you speak arabic very badly i studied it at oxford i am delighted to be here in cairo to meet with colonel nasser to continue discussions regarding the funding for his grand aswan dam project his arabic is good thank you very good too good i&#x27;m sure the colonel would have been charmed by that on the contrary that night there was a dinner at our embassy he came in uniform military uniform yes whatever for one would think the clue would be in the invitation to dinner that one would wear a dinner jacket he came as if we&#x27;d invited him to battle and promptly behaved like that your excellency prime minister eden is anything the matter no one told me it was formal dress tonight no matter sir it&#x27;s just a suit but the wrong suit sensing his embarrassment and wishing to spare him further blushes i tried to make the situation better if i was as decorated as you sir i would wear my uniform all the time wouldn&#x27;t take it off you think i don&#x27;t know that you received the military cross for bravery in the first world war and were the youngest brigade major in the british army at you are more decorated than me captain eden that night the voice of egypt radio station in cairo claimed that nasser had been deliberately humiliated by the imperious british oh dear it might be worth extending the hand of goodwill indeed we are ma&#x27;am we&#x27;re bending over backwards to help him fund this dam project things here could do with a little settling too my sister&#x27;s engagement this was their favorite place they would ride out here together and put a single stone down for each time they met i thought this would be the perfect spot for us to discuss the matter you see i gave my sister my assurance that if she waited until the age of she could do as she likes now i discover that&#x27;s not true and that she still needs to wait a year to get permission from parliament which is not the advice that i originally received yes and i&#x27;m afraid to say that even if she were to ask that permission i cannot guarantee that she would get it why because a good many remain opposed to the idea on religious grounds then advise me group captain townsend will be leaving brussels and returning home shortly having done exactly what we asked him to do how can i keep my word after i gave it knowing only half the facts let me take the temperature of the cabinet we must not forget that times are changing morality is changing the country is changing so it was your idea was it dispatching me to the penal colonies if you mean entrusting you to go to melbourne to open the olympic games alone actually it was tommy lascelles oh your puppet i might have guessed and you ought to be flattered to be trusted to cut a ribbon to be given that level of freedom what freedom i have no freedom you have more freedom than any consort in history and you repay it by scowling and skulking like an adolescent so go have some time in the spotlight be the main attraction and enjoy the attention hopefully it will do you some good you might finally be less resentful and more supportive of my daughter in her duty when&#x27;s the wedding day sir are you going to make an announcement anything you&#x27;d like to share mr townsend mr townsend captain townsend when&#x27;s the wedding day prime minister michael sir i discussed the matter this morning with the attorney general and he advised that there was no easy way around the governing rules of the royal marriages act furthermore several senior members of cabinet remain violently opposed indeed lord salisbury has made it clear that he would resign from government rather than submit to what he considers a subversion of the church&#x27;s teachings the holy sacrament of marriage and the decay of moral standards but i realize this doesn&#x27;t help you no so if it is your majesty&#x27;s intention to support your sister come what may it is then the best i can offer is to place a bill of renunciation before parliament it would deprive her of all her rights privileges and income she would have to be married in a civil ceremony abroad and be obliged to live out of the country for several years but you will have kept your word and she will have prevailed and will be mrs peter townsend of course that&#x27;s the strategy what strategy to force me into that choice and bank on the fact that i would never do it oh smart set margaret good time margaret she could never survive without the trimmings i could i could live perfectly happily without the staff without the car without the parties without the attention without the money effortlessly i am more than my title than these privileges peter wouldn&#x27;t want it anyway so if that&#x27;s what&#x27;s on offer i&#x27;ll give up my title and we&#x27;ll leave the country it&#x27;s not what i want for you so please think about it i mean really really think about it fine and while i&#x27;m thinking about it perhaps you could think about this i have a country that is for me newspapers that sympathize with me i represent what a growing majority want the future not the past a kinder more tolerant attitude to marriage and divorce that&#x27;s not me fine then a government in your name slow down here they tried to bribe my butler a hundred pounds can you imagine for a photograph of the two of you it&#x27;s all rather too much isn&#x27;t it the house is under siege and you&#x27;re the cause of it all old boy not bad sweeping up the most eligible woman in the world shall we yes peter no you dance darling i&#x27;ll go to bed you&#x27;re sure i&#x27;m quite sure hello hello margaret sighs everyone is still dancing then why are you here to tell you that i love you thank you and that they&#x27;re just children i know and i&#x27;m mad for you me too her royal highness princess margaret and wartime fighter ace group captain townsend were important weekend visitors at allenby park near windsor pressmen and sightseers hoping for a glimpse of the couple were undeterred by the official statements that no announcement is expected but whatever the answer to the question that millions are asking no one can doubt the warmth and sympathy countless ordinary people have for the queen&#x27;s sister and the former equerry to her majesty since our last meeting i&#x27;ve been thinking a great deal about something that my father said to princess margaret and myself at the time of the abdication he made us swear as sisters never to put anything or anyone before one another in the way that he felt his brother had it&#x27;s an oath that we both made and that we intend to keep but i can&#x27;t see how i&#x27;m to honor it it is my duty as queen to refuse margaret marriage to a divorced man everyone advises me so and yet i will be breaking a promise not only to my sister but also to my late father and the one body of people who might make it possible for me to keep my promise is cabinet a group whom i&#x27;ve learned count no fewer than four divorced men in their number yes yourself included prime minister indeed now i wonder in light of this whether you might go back and use your considerable influence and ask your cabinet colleagues if they might reconsider their decision to oppose the marriage certainly ma&#x27;am although i feel i should warn you that there still will be the church yes well i&#x27;ll see to that the archbishops of canterbury and york the bishop of durham and is that winchester bath and wells ma&#x27;am the big guns the four horsemen of the apocalypse marriage is a sacrament of god the cornerstone of our christian family life its foundation and its rock and according to the canon law of the church of england indissoluble put simply there are no circumstances where the church might permit the remarriage of divorced persons while the husband or wife of the former marriage is still alive even if he was the innocent party no circumstances at all that makes my position very difficult to forbid the marriage would risk breaking up my family your majesty as queen you are fidei defensor defender of the faith that was the oath you made at the coronation i married the man of my choice i&#x27;d like to think she could do the same well the way i look at it if she really likes the fella time to concede it would seem give the people what they want do they really know what they want quite frankly the world today isn&#x27;t what it was a few years ago and he was not the guilty party i think they&#x27;re making it very clear well the archbishops just made themselves clear too you don&#x27;t need to listen to them surely as head of the church of england i thought i might oh well in the name of the people that live with you and love you might i suggest not being head of the church for a minute or head of state or head of the commonwealth of nations or the army or the navy or the government or the fount of justice or the whole damn circus frankly and be what a living breathing thing a woman a sister a daughter a wife all ready for you your majesty elizabeth i&#x27;ve been hoping to hear from you i&#x27;ve found myself hovering by the phone for days is it about margaret yes the french are very much for her at least paris is which is the only france that matters and are you for her too for margaret &#x27; la marianne &#x27; how can i not be i share with her the fate of having a great love that captured much of the country&#x27;s imagination only to have it forbidden by the establishment so naturally my sympathy is with her i see but there is also the other great love of my life the crown and protecting that crown and i imagine you find yourself in a difficult position now split down the middle one half is sister one half is queen exactly a strange hybrid creature like a sphinx or gamayun as i am ganesha or minotaur we are half people ripped from the pages of some bizarre mythology the two sides within us human and crown engaged in a fearful civil war which never ends and which blights our every human transaction as as brother husband sister wife mother i understand the agony you feel and i am here to tell you it will never leave you i will always be half king my tragedy is that i have no kingdom you have it and you must protect it her royal highness princess margaret i&#x27;ve asked you here to say that i&#x27;ve given the matter thought a great deal of thought the issue of your marriage has for the past weeks months gone to the very heart of a great number of things the country morality divorce but also something closer to home who i am what i am and your marriage to peter wait i no please margaret it doesn&#x27;t come naturally for me to speak like this so please let me finish it&#x27;s involved going against members of our family against senior courtiers against cabinet you know how i hate confrontation or mess or dereliction of duty but i was prepared to go through it all and support you as a sister because i&#x27;d given you my word but but but what but i realized as queen that i have no choice i cannot allow you to marry peter and remain part of this family that is my decision in defiance of the pledge you made to our father and the pledge you gave to me yes will you forgive me if you deny me the man i love if i put duty before family would you forgive anyone who denied you philip it doesn&#x27;t compare it compares exactly in marrying philip i wasn&#x27;t violating the scriptures or offending the church i&#x27;m so sorry you will love others no never peter is the only one i understand that it feels like that now but margaret i know i appear strong but i&#x27;m not peter is the only one who knows how to calm me to reassure me protect me don&#x27;t tell me you understand that you don&#x27;t know for a minute what it is to be unhinged be flailing about well peter is the only one who can hold me together without him i&#x27;m lost i will never forgive her and i will never marry anyone else ever you&#x27;re the only one i would like it to be known that her royal highness the princess margaret and i have decided not to marry mindful of the church&#x27;s teaching that christian marriage is indissoluble and accepting my position as a divorced man and knowing how deeply religious faith and commitment to the church runs within the princess we have resolved to make the ultimate sacrifice and break off our relationship with immediate effect her royal highness the princess margaret and i are strengthened by the unfailing support of the royal family whom it has been my honor and my privilege to serve for these last ten years i will now return to brussels to continue my important work as air attach mr townsend would you like to make a comment the days between peter townsend&#x27;s return to london and the princess&#x27; decision were a period of mounting suspense now she has put her royal duty first outside clarence house the day after the announcement people hoped to see and encourage her the hearts of all britain and the commonwealth are with the young princess who has chosen not self but country the group captain flies back to brussels the end of a story of love and duty with duty prevailing apparently the prime minister called nasser in an attempt to defuse the situation but it seems the egyptian leader took offence again why this time because the pm refused to speak a word of arabic insisting on speaking english what&#x27;s the matter with that aha well it seems nasser hadn&#x27;t arranged for a translator to be present which left him exposed since he doesn&#x27;t speak sufficiently good english he felt tricked and humiliated and has taken the whole thing as a terrible affront there is some personal history between the two men i believe oh dear well i do hope it all calms down i&#x27;m off where are you going we are ready for her majesty to meet the president of the olympic committee as instructed they now suggest i combine opening the games with a royal tour stay away even longer five months a long way to go a long time for a father to be away from his children but no if it gives me time to reflect and work out my priorities and to settle not just in the marriage but you know generally it&#x27;ll be worth it don&#x27;t be like that everyone&#x27;s just trying to help oh yes by putting a problem on a boat to australia and hoping it sorts itself out or better still sinks you know it is possible that you might enjoy it and thank me don&#x27;t dress betrayal up as a favor better go can&#x27;t stand around chatting your majesty will you be back late i&#x27;ll be right with you cecil good afternoon thank you your majesty britain and the west despise arabs prime minister eden thinks he can insult us you can leave now thank you we will fight to the last drop of our blood try standing up ma&#x27;am that&#x27;s it there all hail sage lady whom a grateful isle hath blessed not moving not breathing our very own goddess glorious gloriana forgetting elizabeth windsor now now only elizabeth regina

see him aaron to know what i&#x27;m saying you need to see him sitting out in the hall right now &#x27;cause i&#x27;m telling you i&#x27;ve never seen anything like him that&#x27;s exactly what i mean because of the way he&#x27;s lived uh he doesn&#x27;t seem to know what things are i mean things you and i take for granted common everyday objects simple ideas i just don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s ever been exposed to them i mean he&#x27;s about the most well read teenage kid you could ever meet but in other ways i think he&#x27;s a lot like a little child why you look like that you look like some kind of vampire from outer space or something they kick you out of cancer camp you got some kind of disease don&#x27;t look at me man did you hear what i said i don&#x27;t like your eyes what&#x27;s a new guy gotta do the first day he gets here he&#x27;s gotta do the due new guy first day first meal he&#x27;s gotta wear his spoon you ever wear your spoon well you got two choices you can either wear

thing we need up there is another mental defective along with all that other trash here you go i don&#x27;t know what he is but retarded he&#x27;s not well aside from the absence of any and all body hair which is a condition not too uniquely uncommon bottom line he&#x27;s a very healthy young man in fact with all that farm work i&#x27;d say you&#x27;re in damn fine shape and the optometrist said his contact lenses will be here the end of the week they&#x27;ll be callin&#x27; him ol&#x27; blue eyes in time for the county fair you guys are comin&#x27; right uh you&#x27;ll see a few of us there hey doc thanks for comin&#x27; out it&#x27;s my pleasure good day mr jeremy reed jeremy listen uh i want you to think about something we attend school in town at wheaton high you certainly wouldn&#x27;t be at an intellectual disadvantage there and i know most of the teachers so anyway um all i&#x27;m saying is if you&#x27;d like to attend school one day next week i can arrange it will my contacts be ready by monday hey hey guys molecules when we speed up the course of molecules we get energy and um since we are all basically just a mass of molecules what does our brain send out to all the other parts of the body lindsey um impulses yeah electric impulses jeremy turn your head and look at lindsey yes that&#x27;s lovely that&#x27;s very good you&#x27;ve just relayed electricity your brain sent out an electric impulse down to your neck muscles and uh what what turned your head besides the obvious what your what your muscles used to turn your head it&#x27;s energy energy always relaying always transforming and never ending now looky here this is a uh a jacob&#x27;s ladder it&#x27;s a science fair toy and it&#x27;s uh built to show us how electricity travels okay can we get the uh shutters watch this ooh hey cut it out cut it out ooh look at this blinding isn&#x27;t it now who can tell me why electricity travels uh boredom huh he tickles me no no potential potential one side of this thing is positive while the other side has a strong negative pull and uh that&#x27;s all the potential that electricity needs to travel that&#x27;s right that&#x27;s pretty good don&#x27;t i bring you good entertaining things but you get the idea that it does you know it travels and just keeps going did you ever what&#x27;s your experience with electricity did you ever you know run your feet over a carpet like that and touch somebody what happens static electricity that&#x27;s right that&#x27;s right now where does it go when you touch somebody it just goes out so so so electricity like energy uh just um uh recycles it flows in a cycle that doesn&#x27;t end it uh are you all right mr ripley are you okay the local news and those channel people are outside so is jimmy hobbs from the newspaper tell them to go home oh come on doug they ain&#x27;t goin&#x27; anywhere till somebody goes out there and talks to &#x27;em tell them there&#x27;s no fatalities no sex

what did hold it hold it doug the kid doesn&#x27;t have a scratch on him heart rate&#x27;s a little irregular but nothing to indicate the kind of electrical shock you&#x27;re talking about right right and he&#x27;s got a hole uh burned in his shirt the size of a bowling ball something&#x27;s happened here something&#x27;s happened here i&#x27;m telling you with everything we know about science about the makeup of the human body what happened in that classroom is impossible that kid attracted an arc of electricity from feet away and not just from the jacob&#x27;s ladder i mean after a second it was like it was comin&#x27; at him out of the whole building you want to know why there isn&#x27;t a hair on him why because he is electrolysis it can&#x27;t grow on him doc roth yes can i see you

    "Основные выводы по проекту:\n",
    "1. Собран датасет на основании предоставленных данных о фильмах и уровне сложности языка. Чтение субтитров произведено с использованием библиотеки pysrt. Обработка и токенизирование текста произведено с использованием библиотеки SpaCy, для векторизации применен TfidfVectorizer в составе pipeline c использованием различных моделей машинного обучения.\n",
    "2. Наилучший результат показала модель LogicsticRegression, второй результат у модели GradientBoostingClassifier. Наихудшие результаты показали модели LGBMClassifier и XGBClassifier. Из-за ее очень долгой работы, результаты подбора параметров изъяты из итогового кода. В целом модели обучаются достаточно долго, что затрудняет подбор гиперпараметров, в т.ч. с использованием Optuna и RandomizedSearchCV.\n",
    "3. Произведен, эксперимент с использованием юниграмов и биграмов на двух наилучших моделях. Использование биграмов ухудшает результат в нашем случае, юниграмы дают лучшее качество моделей.\n",
    "4. Произведен эксперимент по расширению датасета. Так как в основном ошибки выявляются на стадии определения уровней В1 и В2, в модель дополнительно добавлены субтитры фильмов имеющих рейтинг В2 и несколько фильмов с уровнем сложности языка С1. Подобраны данные о фильмах, опираясь на данные об уровне сложности фильмов в сети, и сравнении уровня сложности с уже размеченными в датасете фильмами, опираясь на имеющиеся знания английского языка. Не смотря на снижение качества моделей, что можно в определенной степени объяснить расширением датасета практически на 20%. Таким образом, возьмем за основу модель логистической регрессии, обученной на расширенном датасете. Результаты работы модели на обучающей выборке:\n",
